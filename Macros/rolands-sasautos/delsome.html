<P>I'll be frank, this script, <B>delsome</B>, is for educational purposes.
And the next script, <B>dirtidy</B>, is the same. You'll probably never
use these two scripts but you need to know the techniques used in them
if you are ever to become proficient at writing scripts. I'll set the scene
for this script <B>delsome</B>. You are going to feed a list of files into
this utility as standard input. Each file will be offered in turn to the
user to give them the opportunity of deleting each file. But here is the
thing you need to know about. Since you have piped a list of files into
this utility then that is automatically assumed to be standard input. But
then you have to display each file to the user and get their response for
optionally deleting each file so standard input has to changed back to
being the keyboard. So at some stage you have to redirect standard input
as coming from the keyboard, even though the utility has to accept standard
input as that being piped into it.</P>

<P>I am going to introduce a few techniques here that I have not been introduced
before. And they are very importamt for you to learn if you are ever to
become a script writer. So please bear with me and give this your full
attention.</P>

# Script     : delsome
# Version    : 1.0
# Author     : Roland Rashleigh-Berry
# Date       : 28 July 2003
# Contact    : roland@rashleigh-berry.fsnet.co.uk
# Purpose    : To optionally delete files offered to the user
# SubScripts : none
# Notes      : THIS UTILITY MUST BE PIPED INTO with a list of files to optionally
#              delete.
# Usage      : ls *.log | delsome

  read resp

<P>The first thing to note is that this script has no input parametsr.
It has to be <B>PIPED</B> into. If you remember, the <B>tr</B> utility
is like that. You either redirect into it or pipe into it. Now the trick
with this utility is you have to accept piped input but then you have to
prompt the user and ask them whether they want to delete each file in turn.
So standard input has to come from the terminal. But since this utuility
is piped into then it has to accept standard input from the pipe. So we
have to tell it to change. </P>

<P>The first line of code directs the piped list of files into a temporary
file in the user's home area. The next line of code resets standard input
to be the keyboard. And now we see a new form of a do loop. You see the
&quot;do it now&quot; quotes (the quote with the key at the top left of
your keyboard) surrounding the &quot;cat $HOME/delsome.tmp&quot; statement.
That will &quot;do it now&quot; and list out what is in the delsome.tmp
file. And then each element in that list in turn gets assigned to the variable
&quot;file&quot; and the user will be asked if they want to delete it.
The <B>echo -n</B> has the effect of echoing to the terminal but not throwing
a new line so you can type in the response at the end of the line. It reads
the response (which must either be a &quot;y&quot; or &quot;n&quot;) and
if it is equal to a &quot;y&quot; (note that &quot;=&quot; is used here
and not &quot;-eq&quot; since it is a string and not a number) then the
file will be deleted using the <B>rm</B> command with the <B>-f </B>option
(file). Right at the end, the temporary file gets deleted.</P>

<P>To recap, you have learned some important techniques here. You have
seen information stored in a temporary file in the user's home area. You
have seen standard input reset ready to pick up user response from the
keyboard. You have seen a new form of &quot;do&quot; loop using a file
and using &quot;cat&quot; in do-it-now quotes to list the elements and
so deal with them one at a time. You have seen <B>echo -n</B> used to stay
on one line. You have seen the response read in to the variable resp and
then tested for equality using the &quot;=&quot; symbol for strings rather
than the &quot;-eq&quot; operator for numbers. And you have seen <B>rm</B>
used with the <B>-f</B> option so it deleted files only. And right at the
end you see the tidying up process deleting the temporary file.</P>

<P>This is a short little script that isn't at all important, but you have
learned a great deal.</P>
