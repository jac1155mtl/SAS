<H2>Sources of SAS tips</H2>

<P>You can find a lot of good SAS tips on the Internet. Don't think this
site of mine is a definitive source. It certainly is not. I often look
at the sas Technical Support site to see examples of usage and to attempt
to resolve problems. Outside the official sas site, there is the <A HREF="http://www.sconsig.com/">www.sconsig.com</A>
web site that has hundreds of useful tips and code that you can download.
You can also search that site for the information you need just like you
can the sas Technical Support site. There is plenty of useful examples
in the official sas documentation. And if you don't have a copy of that
then there are a few Universities who have web sites with the sas documentation
who have, perhaps unwittingly, made it available to the public to browse.
So there are plenty of tips out there. And if you are really stuck then
there is the <A HREF="news:comp.soft-sys.sas">comp.soft-sys.sas</A> newsgroup.
So long as you have posting access, you can post your questions or problems
there and somebody should respond quite quickly. There is also a mailing
list called SAS-L that sits behind that newsgroup. For information on how
to subscribe to the list, then check out the <A HREF="http://www.sconsig.com/">www.sconsig.com</A>
web site.</P>

<H2>My SAS tips</H2>

<P>I must have coded more than a thousand sas macros since I started in
late 1986. I've encountered all sorts of problems with them over the course
of these years so I have a lot of tips to give about writing macros. This
will be a very full page and my &quot;pain&quot; will be your &quot;gain&quot;
if you read them and take note. As I think of other tips I will add new
sections and add the items onto the pages but for now the links are as
follows.</P>
