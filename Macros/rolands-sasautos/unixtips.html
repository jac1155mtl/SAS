<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Unix tips for Clinical SAS Programmers</H1>

<P><B>[last updated - 06 August 2003]</B></P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Note the title of this page. These are Unix tips especially for Clinical
SAS programmers. If you are one, like me, and all you want is some useful
shell scripts that you can use when working on Clinical trials then you
need look no further than this page. And I'll tell you when you might need
to use them as well. Sometimes there will be a shell script that you might
like to put in your shell script library. Sometimes it will just be a command
or a few combined commands that do not warrant a shell script being written.
If there is a shell script, then I will briefly describe what it is doing
in an understandable way. At some time in the future, I will add a link
to the bottom of this page where you can find out more about writing shell
scripts. But you will learn a lot from studying these examples here and
I suggest you go through all of these before getting into the more complicated
stuff. You are better off learning by example rather than making an academic
exercise out of it. It is the way of thinking you need to learn more than
anything else. Getting a feel for what should be possible and how simple
commands, combined, make it possible.</P>

<H2>&quot;Unix in a Nutshell&quot; book and &quot;man&quot;</H2>

<P>You need a good book on Unix to hand, if you work on a Unix platform,
and you want to &quot;do&quot; anything useful. And the book will only
go so far, so you need extra help as well. I highly recommend the O'Reilly
book &quot;Unix in a Nutshell&quot; as a concise source of Unix information.
The book can not cover everything but you will find you have a facility
called &quot;man&quot; at your Unix installation (mine is &quot;info&quot;
instead on Cygwin). Suppose you want to find out more about the &quot;tr&quot;
command (mentioned in the first tip), then at the prompt type in &quot;man
tr&quot; and you will see more. In the following tips and scripts, I am
going to assume you know a little something about commonly-used Unix utilities.
But maybe you don't so a book would help but &quot;man&quot; might be enough.</P>

<H2>Shell scripting tips and scripts</H2>

<P>I have ordered the following tips so that they tend to build upon each
other. For that reason I recommend you go through them sequentially. If
I have marked any as IMPORTANT&nbsp;then you must not skip them or you
might not be able to understand the following ones.</P>

<H2>SAS/Unix scripts</H2>

<P>These are scripts that invoke SAS. These have been developed under Cygwin
running on a PC&nbsp;and then converted to run under Unix. As a consequence,
there could be obvious errors in them that will cause them to fail under
Unix. Please help the author by emailing him if you have run this on a
full-blown Unix platform and you have found errors that cause it not to
run.</P>
