<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Things I Hate about SAS software</H1>

<P><B>[This site is not connected with the SAS Institute]</B></P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>I have been using SAS since 1986. But I was programming before then.
I used to be a Cobol programmer and Basic programmer. And since starting
with SAS I have programmed in Modula-2. So I've &quot;been around a bit&quot;
when it comes to computer languages. These languages differ from each other.
You just have to put up with it. What is not so good in one language is
better in another and vice-versa. But very rarely you can come across a
&quot;feature&quot; in a language that is so bad that you feel justified
in having a gripe about it.</P>

<H2>How text fields are stored</H2>

<P>In the following example I have allocated 100 bytes to a string. I want
to assign the letters &quot;aaa&quot; to it followed by six spaces making
9 characters in all and I want to be able to extract that string in a later
data step.</P>

<P><TT>1 data _null_;<BR>
2 length str $ 100;<BR>
3 str='aaa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;';<BR>
4 len=vlength(str);<BR>
5 put len=;<BR>
6 len=length(str);<BR>
7 put len=;<BR>
8 run;</TT></P>

<P><TT>len=100<BR>
len=3<BR>
NOTE: DATA statement used: real time 0.00 seconds</TT></P>

<P>Note that the trailing spaces get lost. I can find out the length of
the field using vlength(). I can find out the length of the string not
counting trailing spaces with length(). But I do not know the length of
the string I assigned to the variable. I would need to keep a separate
variable for this. This is very annoying. Other languages do not work like
that. Most have an internal logic that knows the length of your string
and it gets stored away with the value. And when you read the value again
you only get that length's worth of characters. Sometimes trailing spaces
are significant. If you create footnotes then you will maybe force left-alignment
by padding out with trailing spaces. And SAS honors them as well because
you can left-align footnotes in this way. So SAS stores this important
information for titles and footnotes but does not do this for text variables.
So it is handling text variables in two different ways, it seems. And in
the case of the titles and footnotes then they do not have the sense to
store this length information in the sashelp.vtitle view. So if you need
to be able to reproduce the titles and footnotes after manipulation of
this data in the view then you can not be sure you have the alignment right.
Those stupid, stupid, stupid people.</P>

<P>To get round this problem with the titles and footnotes I had to write
a macro to create a dummy report and read the titles and footnotes back
in from the output and from the alignment to work out the trailing spaces
as best as I can. I don't feel I should have had to do this. You can view
the code for this <A HREF="titlelen.sas">here</A>.</P>
