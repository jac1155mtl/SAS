<P><B>[last updated - 29 July 2003]</B></P>

<P>There is a file comparison utility on Unix called <B>diff</B>. This
is an extremely useful utility if you are a Clinical SAS&nbsp;programmer
for when you want to compare table or listing output. It is a simple matter
to compare one output with another using this utility. You can look up
how to do this. But it becomes even more useful when you can compare an
old set of outputs with a new set of outputs. Suppose you have downloaded
new data and you want to know what changes resulted in the tables or listings.
It would be great if you could move all the old outputs to a subdirectory
and then rerun and compare identically named outputs in the subdirectory
with those in the parent directory. Of course, when you do a new run, there
will be a line on each page saying who ran it and when. So there will be
a difference on every page that you are not interested in. It would be
better if that difference were ignored and just the actual results were
compared.</P>

<P>This is easy to do once you understand how to handle loops in scripts
and &quot;pattern matching&quot;. You can loop through the files you have
in your subdirectory and compare them with those in the parent directory
and use what you know about pattern matching to mask the unimportant differences.
If a utility is useful on one file then it can be made to work on many
files with little effort except a bit of script writing. And if you have
studied all the examples up to this point and done the exercises then you
will have come to the conclusion that script writing is not difficult.
But you won't have seen an example yet of one useful utility being made
to work on many files and the resulting extra power at your disposal. This
is where you will see a very practical and useful application of this.</P>

<P>This utility is called <B>ddiff</B>, rather than <B>diff</B>, because
it compares whole directories. It is <B>d</B>irectory <B>diff</B>erence
rather than just the <B>diff</B>erence between two files. The user makes
the subdirectory the current directory and types in the file pattern of
outputs they want to compare with in the parent directory. Temporary copies
will be made in the home directory where superficial information such as
run date will be removed and a comparison between like-named files can
be done. Output, as always, will go to the terminal window, and it is up
to the user to redirect the output.</P>

<P>But here we have to know pattern matching well. In the example below,
I am assuming people use my <B>pagexofy</B> utility to add &quot;Page x
of Y&quot; labels to output and that all the extra transient information
such as date and time and who ran it is on that line. I am going to mask
that line using sed to make a substitution and will explain the pattern
I have used. But for now, here is the utility:</P>

<B>#!/bin/sh
# Script     : ddiff
# Version    : 1.0
# Author     : Roland Rashleigh-Berry
# Date       : 29 July 2003
# Contact    : roland@rashleigh-berry.fsnet.co.uk
# Purpose    : To compare all the outputs in a subdirectory with identically
#              named outputs in a parent directory. 
# SubScripts : none
# Notes      : Refer to documentation on diff. Note that this utility has 
#              pattern matching and substitution in it to mask lines that will
#              always change for each run. You need to amend this for your own
#              standard outputs.
# Usage      : ddiff *.lst
# 
#================================================================================
# PARAMETERS:
#-pos- -------------------------------description--------------------------------
#  1   file or list of files to compare
#================================================================================
# AMENDMENT HISTORY:
# init --date-- mod-id ----------------------description-------------------------
# 
#================================================================================
# This is public domain software. No guarantee as to suitability or accuracy is
# given or implied. User uses this code entirely at their own risk.
#================================================================================

if [ $# -lt 1 ] ; then
  echo &quot;Usage: ddiff t*.lst&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi

for file in &quot;$@&quot; ; do
  echo ; echo ; echo
  echo '========================================================================='
  echo 'Comparing ' $file ': &lt; = lower directory &gt; = upper directory'
  echo '========================================================================='
  sed 's/.*Page .* of .*//'    $file &gt; $HOME/file1.tmp
  sed 's/.*Page .* of .*//' ../$file &gt; $HOME/file2.tmp
  diff -b $HOME/file1.tmp $HOME/file2.tmp 
done

rm -f $HOME/file1.tmp $HOME/file2.tmp</B>

</PRE>

<P>Now to explain the pattern matching in the sed calls. <B><TT>&quot;.*Page
.* of .*&quot;</TT></B> will match any number of characters greater than
zero up to the word &quot;Page&quot; and then a space and one character
at least and then a space and then &quot;of&quot; and then a space and
then one or more characters. It will substitute that whole line with nothing.
I am sure I am going to match my lines with &quot;Page x of Y&quot; on
and blank it out so that these lines will not be compared. If your changeable
line in outputs is different then you will have to amend this utility to
suit.</P>
