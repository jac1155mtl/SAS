<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>SQL vs. data steps</H1>

<P><B>[last updated - 12 August 2003]</B></P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>I have been working in Clinical Trials since late 1996 and still the
debate goes on about using SQL rather than using more traditional SAS data
step processing. I remember SQL (Structured Query Language) being heralded
as the way forward for accessing data from about 1989 onwards. That managers
in the future would all know SQL&nbsp;as part of their job and they would
use it to interrogate corporate databases anyway they were allowed to to
help them make business decisions. That this would lead to corporate data
serving the business better and businesses becoming far more efficient
and effective as a result. Well, as for business managers learning SQL,
then this never happened (though I am sure there are some exceptions).
It seems to me that instead, its main use lies in getting data out of relational
databases - especially IBM's flagship database DB2. So SQL&nbsp;has certainly
found an important niche but not in the way that was hoped for. SQL is
a very powerful tool but has failed to live up to its original expectations.
It has a problem. </P>

<H2>SQL and its technical complexity</H2>

<P>I will give you my own reasoning behind why SQL never became the tools
of managers. And that is because it is too technical and complex by nature.
There is nothing wrong with its design. It is a very good design and could
not have been implemented any better. It is just that it is doing a lot
and doing it often all in one go. This makes sense for a Cobol program
interrogating a relational database such as DB2. These databases are being
updated many times per second so you have to go in and get your information
and get out in the shortest possible time before the data gets changed.
You let the database handle the complexity of the query. This will have
been thoroughly tested before going into production. But the user who calls
this Cobol program to update their screen with information or whatever
will have no concept of the SQL going on behind the scenes. And as for
the managers using SQL to make business decisions, then they had better
be careful with their SQL queries. If they get it wrong then the information
they are presented with could also be wrong and they could make a wrong
business decision as a result. SQL is far too technical and complex to
be an ad-hoc tool unless those using it are highly competent with SQL.</P>

<H2>What SQL&nbsp;can do that data steps can't do</H2>

<P>You can do some things with SQL that you just can not do using data
steps in an easy fashion. If you try to do it with data steps then you
will create a mess that nobody except the original programmer can understand.
And sometimes, when you are clinical reporting, you will need these features
that SQL can do easily. Consider merging on ranges of values. For example,
suppose you have a dataset with dose start and stop dates in. You also
have an AE&nbsp;dataset with an onset date in. You want to know what dose
the subject was on when they had their AE. How would you do that with data
steps? You can do it with SQL rather easily. In fact one of the macros
on my web site does exactly that. It is called <A HREF="dosemerge.sas">%dosemerge</A>.
Here is another example. You need to merge a count of events on top of
a zero count of all possible events for all treatment groups. So let's
say you create a dataset with all events in and you have a dataset with
the different treatment arms in then you can do this with using a pointer
for the treatment dataset and outputting a value for each event and each
treatment group. But instead of just two values you may have more and this
starts to become messy with a data step. It is easier and better to use
SQL. I have a macro on my web site that does this called <A HREF="zerogrid.sas">%zerogrid</A>.
So you see there are occasions where you will end up using SQL when writing
clinical reporting programs.</P>

<H2>Risks of SQL in Clinical Reporting</H2>

<P>The inherent complexity of SQL creates a risk if used in ad-hoc clinical
reporting programs. All these programs will go through some sort of QC.
Some of these programs will just go though a code review as part of the
QC process. Some will be independently programmed. But if you have an SQL-heavy
program being code-reviewed by a programmer who is not used to SQL (and
maybe doesn't want to let on) then that most important part of the program
will be passed over with just a cursory glance. So if your programmers
are not used to SQL then maybe it is better not to use it in the first
place.</P>

<H2>The &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach</H2>

<P>Let's think abou the <B>&quot;all&quot;</B> approach. If all your programmers
know SQL well then writing clinical reporting programs in SQL will not
be a problem. And to know it well you would have to use SQL nearly every
day and so to achieve that level of usage you might as well write all your
dats stpe-type code using SQL and have done with it. I mean to the extent
of never having a data step in your code where an SQL&nbsp;step could do
the job instead. This would take a bit of initial training for every programmer.
This could be expensive but if you had internal training then the costs
could be kept down. A problem can arise whereby a pharmaceutical company
hires contractors to make up for surges in work demand (as most do) and
the contractors do not know SQL. You might have to select only those who
had good SQL experience, though, and it may be difficult to identify those
with this skill. You would probably have to give them an SQL&nbsp;test
as part of the selection process. This is an achievable and do-able thing
and you could go all the way over to the SQL way of doing things. And,
to my way of thinking, there is no halfway house.</P>

<P>On the other hand you could use the <B>&quot;nothing&quot;</B> approach.
Yes, you need to use SQL sometimes, as in the two examples I cited above,
but you <B>needn't see any SQL</B>. You can hide it, instead, like I have
hidden it in the two macros <A HREF="dosemerge.sas">%dosemerge</A> and
<A HREF="zerogrid.sas">%zerogrid</A>. If you identify when you should use
SQL then it can always be written into a macro that you call. This macro
could be thoroughly checked and thus &quot;validated&quot; so that you
know it produces correct results and the programmers could forget about
the SQL in it and just call it. And since they will be &quot;validated&quot;
macros then the output could be relied upon and require no further checking.
So if not all your programmers are happy with SQL then I don't think it
does any good having SQL programmers mixing with non-SQL programmers and
exchanging code. You could, instead, hide the SQL in macros and then have
no SQL in your clinical reporting programs whatsoever. And to my way of
thinking, again, there is no halfway house.</P>

<H2>My recommendation</H2>

<P>I've only decided this today after all the years I have worked doing
clinical reporting. And that is to adopt the &quot;all or nothing&quot;
approach. If use of SQL is well advanced in your company then go the whole
way and even ban use of data steps. There is a downside to this, however.
At least with data step merges you can add code to them to run diagnostics
where matches are expected and not found. Not so with SQL. It is much harder
to QC SQL-heavy programs. Another downside is that trainee programmers
can not be expected to program with SQL from Day One. They will need further
training and until then their efforts might be better confined to QC programming
and ad-hoc tasks. Maybe not contractors either unless they have been carefully
selected. But if you are not beyond the half-way stage using SQL then I
recommend you drop use of SQL altogether except in utility macros that
have been written and validated to do those chores that SQL does best.
There is a downside to this as well. Coding can become lengthier. But a
lot of the coding could be to do with creating work datasets and sorting
them in order before merging them. But if you are well organised then all
your intermediate datasets you report from will all be in the same order
(by &quot;subject&quot; or whatever variable you use to uniquely identify
those enlisted into the study) and so you can do direct merges with these
datasets (you can sort whole libraries in desired order if you use my macro
<A HREF="supasort.sas">%supasort</A>). This will allow your trainees to
be productive straight away and your contractors should have no problems
if you tell them they are not allowed to use SQL and must instead call
standard macros when its functionality is required.</P>

<P>It is important to know what SQL can do for you and to have utility
macros that call SQL that can do these tasks that SQL does best. But my
recommendation for any site where this issue has not been decided is to
<B>NOT use SQL</B> inline in clinical reporting programs.</P>
