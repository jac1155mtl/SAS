<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Testing for the existence of a global macro variable</H1>

<H2>Declaring it %global</H2>

<P>I mention this on my <A HREF="macrotips.html">macro tips</A> page but
I thought I would expand on it here. Let us say you want to do a bit of
processing but it will be different if a global macro variable has been
set. So you want to check on whether it exists or not. If you try to resolve
its value and it has not been set up then you will get an error message
and you want to avoid that. There is a quick and dirty way to do this and
I will tell you about it before going on to more complex methods. That
is - declare the macro variable as global like this - <B>%global globvar;</B>
. Nearly every SAS&nbsp;programmer I know of makes the mistake in thinking
that if you declare a macro variable as global then you will destroy the
contents of that variable. This is not the case. Declaring a macro variable
as global <B><I>promotes</I></B> that variable to be global if it was not
before. The contents of that variable are not affected. So all you have
to do is to declare it global and test its contents. If it has a value
then it must have been set up somewhere and so it must exist. I use this
technique a lot. It is quick and dirty but it does the job. But maybe you
need a better solution.</P>

<H2>sashelp.vmacro &amp; dictionary.macros</H2>

<P>Information about what macro variables have been set up can be found
in the <B>sashelp.vmacro</B> view and the <B>dictionary.macros</B> SQL
view so you can use these views to find out if the global macro variable
already exists. There is a <B>&quot;scope&quot;</B> variable which will
be set to <B>&quot;GLOBAL&quot;</B> for global macro variables and the
name of the variable will be in uppercase and in the <B>&quot;name&quot;</B>
field. Because getting to this information may not be convenient I wrote
a function-style macro to return a list of global macro variables called
<A HREF="globlist.sas">globlist</A> and one to check for the existence
of all of one or more global macro variable called <A HREF="globexist.sas">globexist</A>.
These macros do not contain any procedural or data step boundaries so it
can be used in macro code in the form:</P>

<P><B><TT>%if %globexist(globvar) %then .....</TT></B></P>

<P>...and I assume the above is the most convenient form for finding out
whether a global macro variable exists. No quick and dirty trick as in
the previous section is used. The macro effectively reads the sashelp.vmacro
view using SCL code called from a macro. Although it is opening, reading
and then closing a SAS view, it is not using a data step to do this nor
a procedural step.</P>

<H2>%symdel</H2>

<P>At some stage you might want to delete all your global macro variables.
You can do this with the %symdel command and if you combine it with the
%globlist macro then it becomes a very simple matter. Look at the log below.</P>

<P><B><TT>1 %let test1=1; <BR>
2 %let test2=2; <BR>
3 %put _global_; <BR>
GLOBAL TEST1 1 <BR>
GLOBAL TEST2 2 <BR>
4 %symdel %globlist; <BR>
5 %let test3=3; <BR>
6 %put _global_; <BR>
GLOBAL TEST3 3 </TT></B></P>

<P>You will see in the log that I set up two (effectively) global macro
variables <B>test1</B> and <B>test2</B> and then displayed them using the
<B>%put _global_</B> command. (Note that if these macro variables exist
in open code then they are treated like global macro variables and recognized
by SAS macro code as such. There is no need to declare then as global).
I then use <B>%symdel %globlist</B> to delete these global macro variables.
Then I create a third global macro variable called <B>test3</B>. So when
I display these global macro variables using the <B>%put _global_</B> statement
you will see that only <B>test3</B> is left. </P>

<P>Note that %symdel only acts on global macro variables. Also you should
note that (for some strange reason) if you use %symdel in the form:</P>

<P><B><TT>%symdel &amp;var;</TT></B></P>

<P>...inside a macro then you might get a syntax error but it will work
outside a macro in that form without a problem. This is a known bug and
there is a fix for it which you can read about <A HREF="http://support.sas.com/techsup/unotes/SN/005/005975.html">here</A>.</P>
