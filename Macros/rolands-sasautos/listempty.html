<P>This is a QC'ing tool. You go to the output directory with your tables
or listings in it and type in something like <B><TT>&quot;listempty *.lst&quot;</TT></B>
and it will show you a list of all the files that fit this bill that are
empty. I'll go straight into the code of this utility and then explain
any features you might not have seen before. Copy and paste the code into
a member called &quot;listempty&quot; in your shell script library.</P>

# Purpose    : To list &quot;empty&quot; files

<P>The header and check for number of parameters and writing a usage message
to standard error I assume you are familiar with. If not then please refer
to the previous examples as I will only explain what follows it. The rest
of the code might be a puzzle, though. See the <B>&quot;shift&quot;</B>
command in the <B>&quot;do...done&quot;</B> loop? This is another way of
performing a loop. I'll explain...</P>

<P>I'm going to explain about <B>shift</B>. When you type in a command
like <B><TT>&quot;listempty *.lst&quot;</TT></B> then the script does not
see the parameter as you typed it. Instead of the <B><TT>*.lst</TT></B>
you typed in it sees what the command interpreter gives it. This scans
your command line before anything else is allowed to see it. The command
interpreter sees <B><TT>*.lst</TT></B> and matches every file it can to
it and turns it into a list. So instead of <B><TT>*.lst</TT></B> the command
interpreter might translate it into something like <B><TT>aa.lst bb.lst
cc.lst dd.lst</TT></B> etc., depending on what files in that directory
match the pattern you specified, and this is what your shell script receives.
Now think of the command you type in as parameter <B>0</B> and that you
can refer to its name as <B>$0</B>. The first of the file names will be
parameter <B>1</B> and you refer to its contents as <B>$1</B>. The next
parameter is <B>2</B> and you refer to it as <B>$2</B>. And so on up to
parameter <B>9</B> where the rest of the parameters are all lumped together.
Now what you can do is <B>shift</B> the parameters along. When you <B>shift</B>
parameters then <B>$1</B> gets lost and <B>$2</B> becomes <B>$1</B>. You
can keep doing this until none are left. Have a look at the above code
again. You see my test <B><TT>while [ $# -gt 0 ]</TT></B>?. This is testing
if the number of parameters left are still greater than zero. In other
words whether I have one or more parameter values left to work on. This
will be a file name. So then I test whether the file contains something
using <B><TT>if [ ! -s $1 ]</TT></B> which you can think of as <B>&quot;if
not something in file named to parameter 1&quot;</B> and if this condition
is met it echoes the filename to standard output. Then it has done its
work for that file so it makes the next filename available in position
one by <B>shift</B>ing everything along one. And it keeps doing this until
nothing is left.</P>

<P>I've used shift in this script but you would more often see it used
in a script where your first one or two parameters were not file names
but your third parameter was. You'd then assign the parameter values that
are not file names to variables and then shift until the first file name
was at position 1. You would then use the loop like the above that shifts
one along each time you are finished with a file until you were done with
all of them.</P>
