<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;stacked&quot; column reports using data _null_</H1>

<P><B>[This site is not connected with the SAS Institute]</B></P>

<P><B>[last updated - 15 January 2003]</B></P>

<H2>Just when you were getting good with &quot;proc report&quot;</H2>

<P>It took you a long time to get good with &quot;proc report&quot;, I
bet. Using those order variables, using order=internal so things came out
in a sensible order Clever use of &quot;order noprint&quot;. And then there
were those &quot;group&quot; variables that you had to define before an
across variable. And you learn the magic tricks to get your report to &quot;flatten&quot;.
Now you are good at it and maybe you haven't touched those messy &quot;data
_null_&quot; reports in years. </P>

<P>If that describes you, and you are a Clinical SAS programmer, then have
I got bad news for you. <B>data _null_</B> is making a comeback and with
a vengeance. Some very nasty data _null_ reports will be landing in your
lap any day now. They may look like proc report output. But when you try
to code them using proc report you will find yourself getting into difficulty.
And the more you try to make it work, the more complicated and messy it
will become. And when you finally get the report out somebody says &quot;Oh,
it isn't quite right, it needs changing so that it does this&quot;. So
you go back to it and amend it some more. Your input dataset is now going
through thousands of lines of code so that proc report will display it
in the way you want. It gets so complicated that even you don't understand
what it is doing any more. And that's bad because you are the person who
wrote it. In the end you just hope the output is correct. And you hope
you are miles away, working for a different company, before it goes wrong.</P>

<P>But why this vision of doom and gloom? Well it has to do with the FDA
guideline of using 12 point fonts for tables for electronic submissions.
This restricts the number of columns and lines you can fit on a page. And
on top of that, they want a one inch margin left around the page. This
restricts it even further. So now, if you use a 12 point mono-spaced font,
you are limited to 90 columns across the page and only about 43 lines on
a page, even after you have used a method to cram the lines closer together.
And because the space is restricted, there isn't the room for separate
columns across the page for some of the items. And because the Clinical
people in your company are used to seeing certain things on a report, and
because there is now a lack of space, the standard templates get redesigned.
Values that used to be shown in separate columns get moved. They get stacked
on top of each other. Investigator maybe goes under subject number. Age,
race, sex and weight go in the same column. So when you see this template,
you get fooled into thinking proc report can do it because it looks very
much like proc report output as it was proc report output originally. So
you set out to code it using proc report. And who knows - that <B>one</B>
template page could well have been done using proc report. But don't assume
from that, that you can use the code to produce an entire report.</P>

<H2>What &quot;proc report&quot; won't do for you</H2>

<P>You could define every field in proc report as &quot;display&quot;,
then so long as you had arranged your input dataset to give you what you
want then it would display it for you. But if you expect proc report to
do what it normally does but slightly differently, then you are going to
be disappointed. You might want proc report to flow a string of values
into a column for you. That's no problem. You set the option to &quot;flow&quot;
in your column definition, you define the split character as one of the
procedure options and you have these split characters in all the right
places in your input field. Proc report will flow it for you. But when
it flows a column it makes the whole row &quot;fatter&quot;. It will not
flow into space that other data lines don't use. So the following data
line will occur <B><I>after</I></B> where the column has flowed to. If
you are flowing four items like age/race/sex/weight then that will leave
a gap of three lines before the next data item is displayed. It's no good
hoping you can set some option so that it will intelligently use space
and avoid leaving gaps. It won't. It never will. And because you have a
four-high stacked identity variable then proc report wouldn't start that
on the last line on a page, would it? That would look stupid after all.
Would it do such a thing? Yes, it will. Proc report cares nothing about
the problems the FDA have visited upon you. It will just carry on working
in the same old way. So if you want your reports to look &quot;just so&quot;
you have a choice between doing massive manipulation of your dataset going
into proc report and just using proc report as a proc print to display
the values - or - you go back to using data _null_ reports. And what might
have taken you five minutes to do on a wide page with proc report now takes
you maybe five hours to code. Maybe much, much longer because your data
_null_ reporting skills have gone rusty. And there are a lot of young programmers
in the industry. Maybe you have never produced a data _null_ report in
your life.</P>

<H2>The worst reporting scenario</H2>

<P>I am going to show you how to code a data _null_ report covering the
worst scenario I can think of. It will have age/race/sex/weight stacked
in a single column. And since this is an identifying &quot;order&quot;
variable then the whole column will have to be repeated on each new page.
And if we are near the foot of the page then it would be silly to start
the group so it will be put on the following page instead. And on the right
of age/race/sex/weight we will have a long parameter description grouping
one of more values. And this long parameter will sometimes not fit into
the column and so it will have to be &quot;flowed&quot; manually into the
line below it. It will be the worst reporting scenario you are ever likely
to be faced with. But seeing the code and having it as reference should
allow you to tackle any report of any degree of complexity in the future.
What I won't cover in this section is how you get data _null_ reports to
interface with #byval and #byvar entries in the title lines. I have already
written this up fully on this <A HREF="datanull.html">page</A>. I want
to keep the code free of that so you have more chance of following it.
But if you have never come across a data _null_ report then maybe that
page could act as a gentle introduction to the subject. </P>

<H2>The code</H2>

<P>This is my latest attempt at the code to do a stacked-column report.
Horrible, isn't it?</P>
