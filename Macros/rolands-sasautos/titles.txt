*<pre><b> This is the titles and footnotes template flat file
* that will be read in by the %mktitles macro.

* You can write what you like as comments outside a program:/end: block
* and it will be ignored. Also you can do the same after the program:
* line or suffix: line and it will be ignored. The program identity
* must follow program: and be on the same line. The same for suffix:
* But titles and footnotes must be on the lines following the titles:
* and footnotes: label. You can make copies of the ruler line and
* place this at allowed places for comments as shown below to help you
* get the lengths of these correct.

(It makes no difference if you start comments with an asterisk but
obviously you must not start a comment line with program:, seq: etc.)
