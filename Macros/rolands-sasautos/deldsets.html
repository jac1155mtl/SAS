<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Deleting datasets more than a month old</H1>
<B><P>[This site is not connected with the SAS Institute]</P>
<P>[last updated - 29 August 2003]</P>
</B><H2>CRDATE</H2>
<P>Because you do not see this field in your SAS&nbsp;datasets, SAS&nbsp;programmers tend to forget that it is available for them to use. CRDATE is a datetime stamp for when a dataset is created. There is another datetime stamp called MODATE for when the dataset was last modified. CRDATE is very useful when it comes to managing a library of datasets that get updated on a regular basis, such as once a week, where you have to roll off old data. You can obtain the value of this variable from the <B>sashelp.vtable</B> view or the <B>dictionary.tables</B> SQL view. </P>
<P>In the following code, datasets in a library called SASLIB will be identified if the creation date is more than 27 days older than the date of the SAS job and will be deleted.</P>
<B><TT><P>%let lastmonth=;</P>
<P>proc sql;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;select memname into :lastmonth separated by ' ' <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from dictionary.tables <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;where libname='SASLIB' and today()-datepart(crdate) &gt; 27; <BR>
quit;<BR>
run;</P>
<P>proc datasets nolist lib=SASLIB; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;delete &amp;lastmonth; <BR>
run; <BR>
quit;</P>
</B></TT><H2>CRDATE/CRDTE and MODATE/MODTE</H2>
<P>Just to confuse matters, SAS have got two forms of spelling for these two variables. If you use the <B>attrn</B> function to give you numeric information about a dataset then instead of MODATE you use MODTE and instead of CRDATE you use CRDTE. I have two macros for extracting this information using the attrn function called <A HREF="modte.sas">modte</A> and <A HREF="crdte.sas">crdte</A>. But you would probably be better off just extracting this information from <B>dictionary.tables</B> like I did in the code above.</P>
