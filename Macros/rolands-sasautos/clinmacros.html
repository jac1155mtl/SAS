If you do copy and paste then choose the browser option to look at the
&quot;source&quot; of the page and copy and paste that. This is because
html translates some of the macro references into something else.</B></P>

<P><B>All these macros have html tags as part of the header box and will
appear as &lt;pre&gt;&lt;b&gt; in the first line. They are not part of
the code. They just help them to display correctly when you browse them
using web pages. You should remove these tag markers if you intend to use
the macros, although they will not affect the code since they are part
of the commented-out header.</B></P>

<P>The entire set of clinical reporting macros and the sasautos macro they
call can be downloaded by clicking on this <A HREF="sasautos.zip">link</A>.</P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>These macros are very much &quot;under development&quot; and more will
be added as time goes by. They are not stable like the sasautos extensions.
If you are interested in these macros then check back every week or so.
Even if there are no extra macros listed on this mage then existing ones
could have changed. Some of these macros are very complex, but a full description
as well as usage notes will be in the header of each macro. Note that most
of these macros call the sasautos extension macros I wrote. If you use
these macros you will need to download them and add them to your sasautos
search path. You can get access to these macros by clicking on this <A HREF="sasautos.html">link</A>.</P>

<P>My aim is to help you to understand how a Clinical Reporting system
hangs together and to give you enough example code so that you can design
and build your own. Since I am not a statistician, I will be concentrating
on Safety reporting. Included will be features such as a Titles and Footnotes
handling. </P>

<P>And remember - this is public domain code. I have donated it all to
the public domain so it is now as much your code as mine. It is <B>FREE
!! </B>You don't need my permission to download it or use it. Do what you
like with it. If you are really enterprising, you could use this code to
help set up a Biostats department for a CRO start-up. You could become
a <B>millionaire</B> and not give me a penny.</P>

<H2>popfmt</H2>

<P>This macro is for putting a population total of the form (N=nnn) at
the end of a string. You supply it with an existing format that maps treatment
arm codes to a short description and you give it a population dataset that
you can subset on the population you are interested in. It then creates
a new format with the (N=nnn) string at the end. By default, the output
format it creates will be the same name as the input format but with an
&quot;n&quot; at the end of the format name. Since population totals are
useful for other purposes it creates a dataset named &quot;popfmt&quot;
that you can use after the call to this macro.</P>

see its test pack click here <A HREF="testpopfmt.sas">testpack</A>.</P>

<H2>npctcalc</H2>

<P>This is for calculating &quot;n&quot; and &quot;pct&quot; for AE&nbsp;tables.
&quot;n&quot; will be the number of subjects having an adverse event and
&quot;pct&quot; will be the percentage of the total/level/population depending
on the option you choose. The macro aetab, the one that actually outputs
the report, will call it. I thought it would be a good idea to keep this
as a separate macro so that you could still make use of it if your reporting
style for this table was completely different to what I'll be doing in
the aetab macro.</P>

<P>This is finished but requires further testing and may be changed. You
can view the current version <A HREF="npctcalc.sas">here</A>.</P>

<H2>npcttab</H2>

<P>I was going to call this macro &quot;aetab&quot;, but then I thought
better of it. It is the macro that will call npctcalc and then create the
table. It has three styles out output. Style 1 is with the level1 and level2
categories in seperate columns. Style 2 is with the level1 and level2 categories
sharing a column but with level2 categories indented for clarity. Style
3 is where level1 categories are not shown at all and it is just a list
of level2 categories. So I think it will be better if shell macros are
written for AE reporting such that aetab1 will be for style 1, aetab2 for
style 2 and aetab3 for style 3. And these shell macros could have many
parameters defaulting so that maybe the user just has to specify the dataset
they want tabulating and not much else. I think it is easier to remember
them that way because the style numbers reflect increasing compression
of the table.</P>

<P>I also decided to put in the facility to &quot;flatten&quot; the table.
That is combine the &quot;n&quot; and &quot;pct&quot; into a single string
in a transposed variable. This will be optional, of course. I notice for
electronic submissions that the tables are becoming very small and having
this option can save a line in the report since there will be no &quot;n&quot;
and &quot;pct&quot; column headers. Instead the &quot;n&quot; and &quot;pct&quot;
will be obvious from the form of it such as &quot;43 (65%)&quot;.</P>

<P>I have finished this macro but I will have to put it through a lot of
testing. You can take a look at the latest version by clicking <A HREF="npcttab.sas">here</A>.To
see its test pack click here <A HREF="testnpcttab.sas">testpack</A>.</P>

Style=3 <A HREF="npct3.txt">ordinary</A>, <A HREF="npct3f.txt">flattened</A>.</P>

<H2>sumtab</H2>

<P>This produces summary statistics for numeric variables showing things
such as mean, min, max, median etc. and counts with percentages for categorical
variables which are either character or numeric mapped by a non-numeric
format.</P>

<P>I have completed this macro but done very little testing on it. There
are bound to be problems. I would be extremely grateful if somebody could
do some extensive testing of it and feed back the problems encountered.
This would save me a great deal of time. I&nbsp;am going to take a break
from it to work on the titles and footnotes system before going back to
it to do more testing. You can view this macro by clicking <A HREF="sumtab.sas">here</A>.

<H2>A Titles and Footnotes System and the &quot;project&quot; macro</H2>

<P>It seems to be common practice to keep titles and footnotes separate
from program code. I don't know why. I can't think of any problem it is
trying to avoid, nor can I think of any advantage it offers that can not
be achieved in other ways. I've seen this implemented using a flat file
and also using a spreadsheet. The sas dataset created from it is often
in the form of having all ten titles and all ten footnotes present as variables
which seems to be wasteful of space. I don't know why people do not use
a variation on the structure obvious from the vtitles view in the sashelp
folder. The choice is an arbitrary one and I now have to make this choice
since I am only going to write a single system. On the basis of it then
other systems can be designed. But I will explain why I am doing it in
the way I have chosen.</P>

<P>Firstly I am opting to use a flat file to contain the titles and footnotes
rather than a spreadsheet. The reason for this is for line length purposes.
The clinical reports produced by the macros I have written use good old-fashioned
fixed width characters throughout. At least I can keep alignment regular
in columns of data this way. So the titles and footnotes will be the same.
And because they are fixed width then I want to be sure that the footnotes
(especially) will not flow over more than one line and also that I am using
the space effectively in each line since space might be at a premium. And
because of this I need to use a ruler to indicate column positions and
this is very easily done using a flat file. So flat file it is. Also I
will center the titles by default and always have footnotes left-aligned.</P>

<P>Secondly, I have decided that the form of the titles and footnotes dataset
should conform closely to that used by sas itself in its vtitles view.
The reason being that if it has served sas well for all these years then
I regard this as the &quot;standard&quot; form for titles and footnotes
and so I will adhere to that standard since I can't think of any reason
not to.</P>

<P>So these titles and footnotes for all the programs in a suite will be
written to a sas dataset having something like the structure of the vtitles
view but with extra variables where needed like a variable containing the
program name. But we have to bear in mind that we will probably be adding
other titles and perhaps an extra footnote as well that we do not want
in this dataset. You may have the top title containing project or protocol
information. Maybe on the extreme right it will display a page number or
a date. The extra bottom footnote might contain a full program and path
name plus the user-id who ran it and perhaps a date and time and maybe
the page number is on the extreme right instead of in a title line. And
if we think about this situation then another consideration arises. And
that is, if we use positions on the extreme right of title or footnotes
lines then we need to know how long our lines are going to be. And we can
only be sure of this when the actual report is produced. Also, more than
one report might be created in one program and it is possible that they
will have different line lengths. So it makes sense to create the extra
titles and footnotes, which might use this rightmost position, only after
the line size has been specified. So to recap, because extra titles or
footnotes might use a rightmost position we can not generate the titles
and footnotes statements until after the line size has been specified.
So we will have to store these pieces on information somewhere until we
can construct these titles and footnotes and the obvious way to hold information
like this is in global macro variables.</P>

<P>Now this is a side note to you to follow through the reasoning in this
section until you fully understand it. We will arrive at a structure for
our reporting system driven by our requirements. But don't worry about
getting lost. There will soon be light at the end of the tunnel. So let
us return to where we left off with our global macro variables.</P>

<P>Now the trouble with global macro variables is that we do not want them
overwritten by the programmer. So we want to set things up in a way where
this will not happen. If we have a list of reserved global macro variable
names then the programmer has to keep referring to this list whenever they
need to set up a global macro variable. This is not convenient. So it is
better to have a reserved <I>form</I> of the global macro variable instead.
Each of our special global macro variables could start with a &quot;ZZ&quot;,
for example, and so all global macro variables starting &quot;ZZ&quot;
could be reserved for use with our system of macros. I am going to use
something similar to this. All global macro variables that both start and
end with an underscore are going to be reserved. It looks clearer that
way rather than having a two letter start since it is easier to distinguish
one variable name from another.</P>

<P>It makes sense to gather all the bits of information we need and store
them in our special global macro variables at the start of the program.
It also makes sense to have a &quot;project&quot; macro tailored for our
project that we can amend as we please. But what parameters should it have,
if any? Well, we might like to pass it the population we will be reporting
on. Also, we might have more than one treatment group variable so we should
have a parameter for that. And we will need a treatment format parameter
to go with that. So that is three parameter for a start. We might need
more. And the first thing we might want to do inside the project macro
is to call a macro that gathers important job information (I have written
a utility macro called <A HREF="jobinfo.sas">%jobinfo</A> that does this).
The next thing to do inside the project macro might be to create a population
dataset based on the population passed. Maybe set up a string like &quot;%let
_poptlt_=Population: Intent-to-Treat&quot; if the value pop=itt is passed
to the macro. There could be many more things we want this macro to do.
You could set up _tmtvar_ to contain the name of the treatment group variable.
_tmtfmt_ to it's format. _fmtout_ to a generated format. And all these
things could be used within the program code since they will be global
macro variables. How about using &quot;if &amp;_popgrp_&quot; in your code
where _popgrp_ is set to a numeric population variable that has the value
&quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;? The more thought you put into this then
the more useful your project macro will be and the more generic your code
can be. But that raises one more point. The programmers have got to be
told somehow what global macro variables have been set up and what they
contain. The best place for this is to write a message to the log.</P>

<P>We have reached the light at the end of the tunnel. Here is a recap.
</P>

<P>1) We will need to add extra titles and footnotes to the ones we have
stored away.<BR>
2) We may use the rightmost position in the extra titles and footnotes
so we should not generate titles and footnotes statements until after the
line size is known.<BR>
3) Because we need to store pieces of information then we should store
them in global macro variables.<BR>
4) Because we do not want our global macro variables overwritten we should
store them in a reserved form - namely starting and ending with an underscore.<BR>
5) We should have a project macro that does this work.<BR>
6) The project macro should call a macro named <A HREF="jobinfo.sas">%jobinfo</A>
that gathers important job information.<BR>
7) The project macro should at least have three parameters for the population
to use, the treatment variable (defaulted to the usual) and the treatment
variable format (defaulted to the usual).<BR>
8) The project macro should create a temporary population dataset for other
macros to use based on the population passed to it.<BR>
9) The project macro should create other global macro variables to help
program code be more generic.<BR>
10) The list of global macro variables set up and their contents should
be written in a clear message in the log so the programmers know about
it.</P>

<P>In the above you can see how a structure can form out of a careful and
thorough process of thought and following through the consequences. In
this case we have the skeleton for an entire Clinical Reporting system.
Add to that the two major reporting macros, npcttab and sumtab, and we
have a sound foundation for a fully fleshed-out reporting system.</P>

<H2>The Titles and Footnotes Flatfile</H2>

<P>I want to allow the user to add comments and especially a ruler line
in the titles and footnotes flat file. Where it picks up information will
be governed by special label lines that end in a colon. The following monospaced
section is a template for this flat file and should be self-explanatory.
The same file without html tags exists <A HREF="titles.txt">here</A>.</P>

<P><TT>* This is the titles and footnotes template flat file <BR>
* that will be read in by the <A HREF="mktitles.sas">%mktitles</A> macro.</TT></P>

<P><TT>* You can write what you like as comments outside a program:/end:
block <BR>
* and it will be ignored. Also you can do the same after the program: <BR>
* line or suffix: line and it will be ignored. The program identity <BR>
* must follow program: and be on the same line. The same for suffix: <BR>
* But titles and footnotes must be on the lines following the titles: <BR>
* and footnotes: label. You can make copies of the ruler line and <BR>
* place this at allowed places for comments as shown below to help you
<BR>
* get the lengths of these correct.</TT></P>

<P><TT>(It makes no difference if you start comments with an asterisk but
<BR>
obviously you must not start a comment line with program:, seq: etc.)</TT></P>

<P><TT>program: &lt;put your program name here&gt; <BR>
seq: &lt;put your sequence number here if required&gt; <BR>
---------1---------2---------3---------4---------5---------6---------7---------8---------9---------0---------1---------2--<BR>
titles: <BR>
Put your first title here. This one will be centered which is standard
for titles <BR>
&nbsp;This second title will be aligned one space from the left <BR>

&nbsp;This is the second footnote and will be aligned one space from the

<H2>Merging with a dose</H2>

<P>This is not a clinical reporting macro but rather a clinical utility
macro. It is to allow you to merge in a dose to match a date in an adverse
event dataset. But I need to explain the thinking behind it so that you
know what you are getting. Suppose you have a dataset with dose changes
in it. You would typically have a start date and end date and the dose
level for the subjects. However, the dose dataset may need &quot;fixing&quot;
to ensure there were no date gaps. And when you come to merge with a set
of dates then there may be multiple observations due to a start date being
the same as a stop date in the previous record. In the case of an overlap,
one approach would be to change the stop dates so that they did not overlap
the following start date. Another approach would be to allow duplicates
but take the lowest non-zero dose, representing the worst case (in other
words a smaller dose bringing on the AE rather than a larger dose). It
all depends on the standards agreed so I wrote this macro to be flexible
so that you can specify how it handles gaps and overlaps. You should not
use this macro blindly. You need to think about how you want it to work
and only use it the way you are supposed to. I would actually recommend
you use an altered version of the macro that enforces site standards, if
rigid standards exist, rather than allow the users to choose its action
via the parameter settings. </P>
