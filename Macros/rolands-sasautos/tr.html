<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Using tr to delete Windows carriage returns</H1>

<P><B>[last updated - 27 July 2003]</B></P>

<P>This is a very important topic for Clinical SAS&nbsp;programmers on
a Unix platform. The sad thing is that most Clinical SAS programmers are
not aware of the problem in this area - much less how to solve it.</P>

<P>A recent development is CROs sending statistical reporting teams information
in exported Excel spreadsheets. For a start-off, they shouldn't be doing
this. All data that a reporting team uses should come from their own Data
Management department. These CROs should be sending this information to
you <B><I>via</I></B> your Data Management department since that department
has the facilities for storing this data for the required length of time
and know the regulations surrounding the handling of data. So my first
recommendation is <B>do not accept any Clinical trials data from any other
source other than your own Data Management department</B>. But the problem
is here and now and things are going wrong. I will tell you what is going
wrong and how to solve it. But in the short-term future you should change
policy so that you only accept data via your own Data Management department.</P>

<P>The problem is that some CROs do not have a SAS licence. And who can
blame them - it is that expensive? So they export data out of their database
to an Excel spreadsheet and send it off as an exported Excel spreadsheet.
It will be a file with a <B>.csv</B> extension. But this is a <B>Windows
file</B>. It is not a Unix file. Both Windows and Unix use ascii characters
but the files are not the same. Windows is based on an old operating system
called DOS (Disk Operating System). If you had a file then you would often
be printing off copies. The dot matrix printers in those days were not
very sophisticated. So at the end of each line in the text file would be
two carriage control characters to help the dot matrix printer work properly.
The first character would be a carriage return character so that the print
head would return to the start of the line. The next carriage control character
was a line feed so the the paper roller would advance the paper by one
line. So at the end of every line in a DOS flat file there would be a carriage
return character followed by a line feed character. And this is true for
all Windows files today, since Windows runs DOS underneath it. But for
Unix, the carriage return character is not used. There is just a line feed
character at the end of the line. The result is that when you read a Windows
file into Unix you are left with carriage return characters at the end
of the lines. And when you read these <B>.csv</B> files into SAS it will
honor the carriage return character as being a real character and will
add it to the end of a variable string, for example, if that occurs at
the end of a line. <B>YOU&nbsp;CAN'T&nbsp;SEE&nbsp;THESE CARRIAGE&nbsp;RETURN&nbsp;CHARACTERS.
THEY&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;INVISIBLE</B>. But they might be there at the end of
a SAS&nbsp;text variable without your being aware of it. I have seen the
confusion it can cause when these carriage return characters end up in
SAS&nbsp;datasets. This is something you should take great pains to avoid.</P>

<P>What you have to do is to delete these carriage returns from the <B>.csv</B>
file. They all have them. If you display the file then you probably will
not see them. But you can display then using <B>cat</B> and set an option
<B>-v</B> like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>cat -v myfile.cs</TT></B>v</P>

<P>...and then you will see them at the end of the line as <B>^M</B> (Cntl-M)</P>

<P>It is <B>important</B> that you remove these characters before you read
these <B>.csv</B> files into SAS. You can use the <B>tr</B> utility to
do this. First convince yourself they are there by using <B>cat -v</B>.
Then delete them using <B>tr</B> like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>tr -d '\r' &lt; infile.csv &gt; outfile.csv</TT></B></P>

<P>Then when you have done that, run <B>cat -v</B> on the output file to
convince yourself they are gone. Note that the input file name and output
file name have to be different. You can not make the same file both input
and output. Do this to every <B>.csv</B> file you get and make sure these
carriage return characters have been removed before reading them into SAS.</P>

<P>Also note that if a programmer works on their PC&nbsp;at home and uploads
the programs to Unix when they return to work, then the same problem occurs.
And this can cause problems when you edit the programs because the editors
get confused by these characters and display things that are not there
or don't display things that are there. You end up editing lines to fix
these problems but you are actually making matters worse. You have to look
out for this.</P>

<P>On a final note, you might have to convert a Unix file to a DOS/Windows
file sometimes. You can do it like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>sed 's/$/\r/' unix.txt &gt; dos.txt</TT></B></P>
