<H2>A new life for &quot;data _null_&quot; ?</H2>

<P>I might be proved wrong on this, and I don't mind, but my prediction
for 2003 is that &quot;data _null_&quot; will come into its own in the
field of Clinical reporting. This seems contrary to the trend towards using
&quot;proc tabulate&quot; and especially &quot;proc report&quot;. Many
Biostats departments are still converting over to &quot;proc report&quot;,
so why am I making a seemingly non-sensible prediction? Well, the reason
lies in what is happening to reports used in electronic submissions. The
FDA's 12 point font guideline for tables in electronic submissions is gradually
turning into law within the pharmaceutical companies. Space on these reports
is now at a premium. The information that used to fit across the page now
has to be crammed in somehow. Information is maybe being &quot;stacked&quot;
in columns. Proc report will happily &quot;flow&quot; columns for you if
you specify the &quot;flow&quot; option and you can control the flow with
split characters. However, following lines in proc report are placed after
where the previous line has flowed to. &quot;Flow&quot;ing effectively
makes a line &quot;fatter&quot;. The flowing won't fill up space that following
lines don't need. So suppose your &quot;order&quot; variable contains age,
race, sex and weight separated by a split character then this will flow
most nicely. But the second data line for that group will be printed on
the line below weight. So that leaves a gap of three lines. Now this would
hardly be an issue if there were 60 lines on a page. But using a 12 point
font limits a page to about 43 lines, even when the spacing between lines
is being compressed. Now you maybe have five title lines and five footnotes.
You have a gap before you start the columns and because you are stacking
values like age, race, sex, weight your columns are going to be 4 deep.
And underneath that you have a header line. And because the data lines
will leave a gap before the first footnote then you are reduced to only
26 lines of data. And if you have a &quot;flow&quot; gap of 3 lines out
of 26 then the report starts to look absurd. The 3 line gap is now a yawning
chasm. The table looks incorrect and unacceptable. And there is worse to
come. Your age/race/sex/weight column has more chance of starting near
the bottom of the page and so getting separated. If you have less than
4 lines left on the page then you shouldn't start it. How is proc report
going to handle that?</P>

<P>It is possible to still use proc report and get round this &quot;flow&quot;
problem by manipulation of the dataset going into it. You then use proc
report to display your data rather than using it naturally. But the code
can become very complex You will need to know how many lines will fit on
a page because you will have to artificially put out a new age/race/sex/weight
on a following page if the previous group has data lines that flow onto
a following page. The code can end up being more complex than if you use
&quot;data _null_&quot;. But there is a niggling problem with &quot;data
_null_&quot; reports. Thankfully they can automatically give us titles
and footnotes using the options &quot;titles footnotes&quot; on the file
statement but there is one thing it will not be able to use that other
procedures can. And that is make substitutions for <B>#byvar</B> and <B>#byval</B>
entries. If a data _null_ report could interface with the titles fully,
as does the other reporting procedures, then I think data _null_ would
be unleashed. For some of the 12 point font tables, programmers could use
data _null_ instead of doing massive manipulation of datasets so that proc
report can display it properly. The more manipulation you do, the less
you can trust the final result. I would say that if your code becomes so
complex that a good programmer could not follow it then it could never
be considered to be &quot;validated&quot;. Sure, it might work properly
on the example datasets you put through it. You may not have had any problems
reported. But what about the next time? Do you know that the routine is
correct or are you trusting to luck? I would say that if you were trusting
to luck then the routine is unacceptable. Using data _null_, the logic
would be easier in some cases, so as long as you did not have a problem
with the #byval and #byvar in titles then in certain circumstances it could
and should be used in preference to proc report.</P>

<H2>%bytitle - a first attempt</H2>

<P>In almost all cases, the line that contains #byval and #byvar entries
is the last title line. We could check the contents of the last title line
by looking in the sashelp.vtitle view and if we found it contained &quot;#byvar&quot;
or &quot;#byval' then we could write the information out to a global macro
variable and then nullify that title line. We could then test for whether
the global macro variable had a value in it and &quot;put&quot; the title
out at the start of the header routine, making substitutions. But in making
substitutions we have to know the case used for #byval and #byvar. Proc
report and other reporting procedures are oblivious to the case used for
#byvar and #byval. It could be #ByVaR and #byVAL for all they care. It
will still be handled the same. So if we do detect any forms of these strings
in the titles and extract it to a global macro variable we need to be sure
we have spotted it. And it is wise to convert it into a standard form like
uppercase, leaving all other characters with unchanged case. This converting
of a mixed case string to a specific form required me to write a macro
called <A HREF="casestrvar.sas">%casestrvar</A>. So to extract the last
title and write it to a global macro variable if it is a &quot;by&quot;
title, I came up with this macro <A HREF="bytitle.sas">%bytitle</A>.</P>

<P>I'll follow this with a piece of code you can run, but I want you to
understand that this method has limitations. These #byvar's and #byval's
could be in any title line - not just the last title line. Also we have
limited knowledge about the titles. We can find out what they are in sashelp.vtitle
but we do not know if there were any trailing spaces defined to them. It
could be that that last title line was followed by 50 spaces or more to
align the title to the left. So to do a proper job we would need to attempt
substitutions in all the title lines and somehow recover the original length
of the titles, adjust for the substitution and then &quot;put&quot; it
at the correct column. I'll be showing you how to do that in the next section,
but for now, take a look at the code required to get data _null_ to use
#byval and #byvar in this very simple case. I'll be using some of the logic
in the next section in any case so it would be useful to study the code.
You might like to copy the following code and run it.</P>

<P><TT>title1 'First title';<BR>
title3 'Third title';<BR>
title5 'For #byvar1 = #byval1';<BR>
footnote1 'First footnote';<BR>
footnote3 'Third footnote';</TT></P>

<P><TT>%bytitle</TT></P>

<P><TT>data test;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do year=2000 to 2003;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do month=1 to 12;<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end;<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;retain bytitle &quot;&amp;_bytitle_&quot; ls 0;<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;if _n_=1 then do;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ls=getoption('ls');<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end;<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if vlabel(year) ne ' ' then newtitle=tranwrd(bytitle,'#BYVAR1',trim(vlabel(year)));<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else newtitle=tranwrd(bytitle,'#BYVAR1','year');<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newtitle=tranwrd(newtitle,'#BYVAL1',left(year));<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put @ (floor((ls-length(newtitle))/2)+length(newtitle)-length(left(newtitle))+1)
newtitle;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;put;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;put @48 'month';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;put @48 '-----';<BR>
return;<BR>
run; </TT></P>

<H2>The final solution</H2>

<P>In order to make our system for handling titles reliable we should assume
it is possible for #byvar and #byval to appear in any title line and process
accordingly. We can let footnotes come out using &quot;footnotes&quot;
on the file statement but we will have to set &quot;notitles&quot; and
do the titles manually. In the previous section I mentioned the problem
with not knowing the title lengths. We have the text in sashelp.vtitle
but we do not know if any trailing spaces were defined to assist alignment.
We need to get this somehow. I do not know where SAS actually stores their
real titles nor how to get at them. The only way I could think of to get
this information was to create a dummy report, read the titles (and footnotes)&nbsp;back
in again, compare with what is in sashelp.vtitle and try to work out the
original lengths from the alignment in the report. To do this I wrote a
macro called <A HREF="titlelen.sas">%titlelen</A>. This adds a length variable
as best it can. It also turns mixed-case #byval and #byvar into uppercase
form so that it is easier to make substitutions. Note that this macro contained
a Windows-type DOS&nbsp;system command to delete the temporary print file
it creates. You will need to amend this line if you are running on a different
platform.</P>

<P>I was going to implement this solution as a macro but I changed my mind.
I think it is better if you are fully in control of the code you have running
in a data _null_. If you could follow the code in the previous section
then you will have no problems understanding the following code. Try copying
it and running it. Experiment using trailing blanks on the title lines.
Although this solution to getting data _null_ to talk to #byvar and #byval
is hardly elegant, it does at least work. And, for me, it unleashes data
_null_ reports and will allow data _null_ to cope with some of the complex
reporting issues that the FDA 12 point font guideline will cause. In the
following code example you will see much better control of the report position
and an option to add a &quot;byline&quot; as per proc report or proc print.</P>

<P>Please not that I am not entirely happy with the solution myself. I
expected to set the &quot;notitles&quot; option in the &quot;file&quot;
statement and have it all working fine. But for some reason, it throws
extra pages if I do this. So I have had to nullify the titles and keep
the &quot;titles&quot; option in my &quot;file&quot; statement. After hours
trying to resolve this problem I find it is a known bug in SAS, with the
identifier <A HREF="http://www.sas.com/service/techsup/unotes/SN/003/003818.html">SN-003818</A>.
The titles can be recreated after the data _null_ has finished by feeding
the &quot;titles&quot; dataset into the <A HREF="titlegen.sas">%titlegen</A>
macro, so having to nullify the titles to get the page throws right isn't
a big problem.</P>
