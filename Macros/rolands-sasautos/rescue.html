<P>Have you ever deleted all the SAS programs in a directory by accident?
I have, and with a tight deadline looming. And I didn't have any backups.
I got back all the SAS programs from the archive and in a short enough
time, though, so it wasn't a problem. But after that I always kept a backup
and I also wrote a script to get back SAS code from an existing log. The
orginal script called a SAS&nbsp;macro I had written to convert a log back
into SAS code but I don't use that method any more. Instead I use <B>awk</B>
to do it. I also use the extra power of the Korn shell or bash shell to
make handling of filenames easier. Here is the script. Copy and paste it
into a member called &quot;rescue&quot; in your shell script library.</P>

# Script     : rescue
# Version    : 1.0
# Author     : Roland Rashleigh-Berry
# Date       : 27 July 2003
# Contact    : roland@rashleigh-berry.fsnet.co.uk
# Purpose    : To get back the source code of SAS programs from their logs
# SubScripts : none
# Notes      : Programs that are &quot;rescued&quot; will have their names suffixed with
#              _rescue to they will not overwrite any good copies of programs.
#              Note that this is a BASH shell script.
# Usage      : rescue myprog
#              rescue myprog1.log myprog2.log
#              rescue l*.log

<P>Note the very first comment line in this program. It is asking for the
bash shell. Instead of asking for the Bourne shell in the form <B>!/bin/sh</B>
it is asking for the bash shell in the form <B>!/bin/bash</B> instead.
If you don't have the bash shell or it doesn't work with the bash shell
then you will have to change that first line to ask for the Korn shell
in the form <B>!/bin/ksh </B></P>

<P>The reason this script needs a different shell to interpret it is because
I am doing something a bit different with the file names that have been
entered as a parameter. I want to chop off any extension to the file names
(whether it is there or not) and put <B>.log</B> there myself. I want the
user to be able to just specify a program name and not bother with a <B>.log</B>
extension if they want to without having to worry whether that is the right
way to do it or not. Also I know the extension will be <B>.log</B> so I
don't care what they have put it. I will force the file extensionto be
<B>.log</B>. With the Korn shell and later the Bourne again shell (bash)
you have more power over handling file names. Do you see the <B><TT>${filename%.*}</TT></B>
in the code? That is saying that I want to drop the extension to the file
name if it exists. I then give it the extension I have chosen. </P>

<P>You should be familiar with the code except for the call to awk. A pattern
is being specified to awk. That is the expression between the &quot;/&quot;s.
It is looking for lines that begin with a numeric digit (1-9) in the first
column. And in the second column it is looking for zero or one numeric
digit in the range 0-9 followed by a space. Then it encounters the ending
&quot;\&quot;. This is called &quot;pattern matching&quot; and if you ever
get good at writing scripts then you will need to know a lot about pattern
matching. So it only accepts lines that match this pattern at the start
of the lines. What follows is a test for the record number being greater
than 1 and making sure there is not a &quot;+&quot; sign in the 11th column
and then it will write out whatever is from column 12 onwards in the input
log file out to a file with a <B><TT>_rescue.sas </TT></B>suffix.</P>

<P>Note that you can run this utility on an entire directory, if you have
lost all the SAS&nbsp;programs, and it will regenerate all the SAS&nbsp;programs
from the logs. Sometimes an edit of a SAS program might get so messed up
that you will feel it would be better to get the old version back from
the log and start all over again. You can do it with this utility.</P>
