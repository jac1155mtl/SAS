<P><B>[last updated - 29 July 2003]</B></P>

<P>A very important utility that I haven't introduced yet is the <B>join</B>
utility. It's a bit like merge in SAS. It comes in useful when you are
comparing lists of things. In this case I am going to develop a script
that checks on the SAS programs in a directory and also checks the list
and log outputs to see which logs and list outputs do not belong to a SAS
program (usually because a SAS program got renamed). This list will then
be fed to the <B>delsome</B> utility so that the user can be prompted to
ask them if they want to delete them. You will need access to Unix when
you read this as you will have to try out some commands. Please make current
a directory where you have sas programs and associated logs and/or listings
and where there might possibly be some logs and listings left over from
previously named programs.</P>

<P>Firstly get a list of sas programs by typing in the command <B><TT>ls
*.sas</TT></B>. If we are going to compare the programs with what logs
and lists are there they we won't be able to join on names with extensions.
We want names without the <B><TT>.sas</TT></B> , .<B><TT>log</TT></B> and
<B><TT>.lst</TT></B> at the end. There are different ways of doing this.
We can use awk and tell it that the field separator character is a period
and ask it to print the first field. Try this:</P>

<P><B><TT>ls *.sas | awk -F. '{print $1}'</TT></B></P>

<P>That works just fine. But I'd like to introduce you to yet another very
useful utility called <B>sed</B>. &quot;sed&quot; is short for stream editor.
You'll probably never use it as such, though. You are more likely to use
it with its substitution facility. I want you to try this command. But
I will warn you now that although the output looks correct the call to
the command is not correct:</P>

<P><B><TT>ls *.sas | sed 's/.sas//g'</TT></B></P>

<P>The output LOOKS okay. The &quot;s&quot; before the first slash tells
you to substitute what is inbetween the first two slashes with what is
between the last two slashes (nothing in this case) and the &quot;g&quot;
at the end tells you to do it not once but globally (repeat until there
are none left). The way it appears to have worked is that it has substituted
&quot;.sas&quot; in the first two slashes with nothing in the last two
slashes. But remember I told you you had to become good at something called
&quot;pattern matching&quot; if you are going to become a script writer?
This is where we get into it a bit more deeply. There is actually something
wrong with the &quot;.sas&quot; in the first two slashes if what you want
to do is substitute the &quot;.sas&quot; in the filenames with nothing.
Try copying this command and submitting it:</P>

<P><B><TT>echo asashello worldysas | sed 's/.sas//'</TT></B></P>

<P>You get left with the message &quot;hello world&quot;. What could be
the matter? Well I'll tell you straight off. They call these patterns &quot;regular
expressions&quot;. You should not, however, get them mixed up with the
RX expressions in SAS. They are not the same thing (and I am somwhat disappointed
that SAS did their own thing with RX). So a period in a regular expression
is not a period. It stands for &quot;any single character&quot;. So in
&quot;asashello&quot;, &quot;.sas&quot; matches with &quot;asas&quot; and
in &quot;worldysas&quot; it matches with &quot;ysas&quot;. And that is
why we get &quot;hello world&quot; coming out. But sometimes we really
do mean a period rather than any character so to tell it we really mean
a period we put an excape character in front of it. This happens to be
a slash also but one that goes the other way. Try this:</P>

<P><B><TT>echo asashello worldysas | sed 's/\.sas//'</TT></B></P>

<P>This time it works okay. No substitution has been done. But let's check
on this command:</P>

<P><B><TT>echo .sashello world.sas | sed 's/\.sas//g'</TT></B></P>

<P>It has matched the .sas at the start of &quot;.sashello&quot;. We want
it to match the end of the line. To do this we add a trailing dollar sign
like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>echo .sashello world.sas | sed 's/\.sas$//g'</TT></B></P>

<P>You will see that this works as we expected it. So the correct command
to drop the &quot;.sas&quot; at the end of a list of files is in the form
above. Try this again with the ls command:</P>

<P><B><TT>ls *.sas | sed 's/\.sas$//g'</TT></B></P>

<P>Hopefully you are satisfied that this is working correctly. The next
thing I want you to do is to sort this list and store it in your home directory
like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>ls *.sas | sed 's/\.sas$//g' | sort &gt; $HOME/saslist.tmp</TT></B></P>

<P><B>cat</B> the output file, if you like, to convince yourself the list
was written to there.</P>

<P>Now we are going to do the same with the log and lst files. Except we
will give the files different names. For the log files, type in this command:</P>

<P><B><TT>ls *.log | sed 's/\.log$//g' | sort &gt; $HOME/loglist.tmp</TT></B></P>

<P>and for the lst files do this:</P>

<P><B><TT>ls *.lst | sed 's/\.lst$//g' | sort &gt; $HOME/lstlist.tmp</TT></B></P>

<P>Now we have three files for the files ending <B>.sas</B> , <B>.log</B>
and <B>.lst</B> . We are now going to <B>join</B> them to find out the
differences. Because we have used the <B>sort</B> utility, at least we
know they are in the right order for joining ( I sort of sneaked in that
utility, didn't I? ).</P>

<P>We don't know how <B>join</B> works yet, so go to your home directory
(you should know how) and let's create some test files. Type in this command
and ebter the values &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;e&quot; for file1.tmp
like this. Use the Ctrl-d key combination to finish inputting these values:</P>

<P><B><TT>cat &gt; file1.tmp<BR>
a<BR>
c<BR>
e<BR>
Ctrl-d</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>cat &gt; file2.tmp<BR>
a<BR>
b<BR>
c<BR>
d<BR>
Ctrl-d</TT></B></P>

<P>Now let's do a straight join without know anything about how <B>join</B>
works:</P>

<P><B><TT>join file1.tmp file2.tmp</TT></B></P>

<P>We see &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; listed. These were the ones common
to each file. But what we are interested in are the ones that do not match.
Let's say file1 contains out sas programs and file2 contains our logs then
we want to list out &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; because they are not
matched with sas programs. The way to do it is like this. Try it out yourself:</P>

<P><B><TT>join -v2 file1.tmp file2.tmp</TT></B></P>

<P>The <B>-v</B> option limits output to unpairable lines. This is what
we want. But we only want those unpairable lines in the second file so
we use the option <B>-v2</B> to specify that we only want the unpairable
lines in file 2 (file2.tmp). So in a sense these will be the log file that
are unpaired with sas programs. It would be useful to put the &quot;.log&quot;
back on the end of these items so try this command instead:</P>

<P><B><TT>join -v2 file1.tmp file2.tmp | awk '{print $0 &quot;.log&quot;}'</TT></B></P>

<P>We have put the extension &quot;.log&quot; back on the mismatched items.</P>

<P>Now we are ready to create this list of mismatched log and lst entries.
Let's call our output file badlog.tmp for mismatched logs and badlst.tmp
for mismatched lst files. First we will write the mismatched log entries
to the output file like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>join -v2 saslist.tmp loglist.tmp | awk '{print $0 &quot;.log&quot;}'
&gt; badlog.tmp</TT></B></P>

<P>Now we will do the same for the lst files but now adding the &quot;.lst&quot;
extension like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>join -v2 saslist.tmp lstlist.tmp | awk '{print $0 &quot;.lst&quot;}'
&gt; badlst.tmp</TT></B></P>

<P>Now we have two temporary files containing a list of files we might
like to delete. We can combine them and sort them and then feed them into
the <B>delsome</B> utility so the user can delete them if they choose.
We can do this like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>cat badlog.tmp &gt; bad.tmp<BR>
cat badlst.tmp &gt;&gt; bad.tmp<BR>
sort bad.tmp | delsome</TT></B></P>

<P>That is the idea, anyway. The trouble is that we are now located in
our home directory and the files are not there. This really needs to be
a script so we don't have to type all this in. But it is important for
you to know about how it works. So here is the script and you are welcome
to try it out after you have copied and pasted it into your script library
and called it <B>dirtidy</B>. If you think you do not have any unmatched
log and list files in your programs directory then create some especially
so you can delete them with this utility.</P>
