<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>There is nothing on this page that is not already on the two pages I
have written about data _null_ reporting. The page that deals with interfacing
with the titles system is <A HREF="datanull.html">here</A> and the one
that deals with doing stacked-column reports is <A HREF="stacking.html">here</A>.
This page only explains techniques used on those pages with more detail.
This page assumes you are a young programmer (I mean younger than me -
I'm 48 as I write) who has been thrown into the field of data _null_ reporting
due to demands of the FDA's 12 point font guideline. It assumes you have
been given the task of creating reports that look like they could be done
with proc report but somehow can not.</P>

<P>To do data _null_ programming well, you have to swallow your pride.
It doesn't matter how clever you are or how up-to-date your SAS&nbsp;skills
are. They count for nothing in this field. Old-timer programmers like me
pre-date proc report. It didn't exist when we first started using SAS.
And when it was offered to us, we laughed at it due to the limited control
you had over the output. Many programmers who got into SAS got in from
other computer languages. Some are ex-Cobol programmers. They are used
to total control of every field on every output page. Even controlling
the throw of that output page. But times changed and the limited control
that proc report had to offer was deemed good enough for most situations.
You could do a good report in a short time using proc report, so people
slowly converted over to using it. Yes, it has limitations, but if you
can accept those limitations then using proc report is more productive
than using data _null_. And so nearly all programmers around at the time
converted over to using proc report instead and have long since forgotten
their data _null_ skills. But with pharma companies accepting the 12 point
font FDA&nbsp;guideline as law, then this has changed. Some reporting templates
have now changed to make them fit on a smaller page and they can no longer
be done conveniently using proc report. It is better to go back to data
_null_. But the technology of using this has been lost. Unless you are
an old-timer, then you are unlikely to hit upon the techniques around at
the time. And when you write the code you will encounter annoying problems
and &quot;features&quot; that make your output not correct at times. If
you hack your code around then you will get into a mess. As you try to
fix the mess, you will get into an even bigger mess. Old-timers can wade
through this mess. They are used to coding reports like this, not only
in SAS but other languages. Only they can do it. Only they will hit upon
the correct techniques. It all comes from experience. As I said - all the
code is already on those two pages, but you may not understand why I am
doing things the way I am. So this page will explain the techniques I have
used and you will understand why I have done things the way I have and
why it has to be done that way.</P>

<H2>Never &quot;put&quot; without an observation</H2>

<P>Never &quot;put&quot; a line without an observation. &quot;<TT>if last.subject
then put;</TT>&quot;? That's no good ! If that was the last observation
for the subject and for all the data in the input dataset and it occured
at the very end of the report on the very last line then that &quot;put&quot;
would cause a page throw and a new title with column headers being output.
So you have a page being output but you have come to the end of your data
in any case. You end up with a blank page with no data on it. Sure - it's
unlikely. But you can not trust to luck. If it <B>can</B> happen then it
<B>will</B> at some time and so you can not use code with this weakness
in it. So how do you get round this? By all means, check for &quot;last.subject&quot;
but use an end= flag after your dataset so you know when you have got the
the last observation. If you have specified &quot;end=last&quot; then &quot;<TT>if
last.subject and not last then put;</TT>&quot; will do the trick. But there
are exceptions. If you are doing a stacked column report then you could
be on your very last observation right at the top of a new page and you
need to complete your stacked identifier values. So suppose there were
four of these and you had a variable named &quot;count&quot; to keep track
then you would have to use &quot;<TT>if not last or count&lt;5 then put;</TT>&quot;.</P>

<P>The same applies to your &quot;linesleft&quot; variable. You will probably
want to leave a blank line before your first footnote and will want to
start a new page. Suppose your variable is named &quot;<TT>ll</TT>&quot;
as it often is. Then &quot;<TT>if ll&lt;2 then put _page_;</TT>&quot; sounds
good. But if it is at the end of the data step then there may not be another
observation after that so you would have to use &quot;<TT>if ll&lt;2 and
not last then put _page_;</TT>&quot;. But if it is directly after the &quot;set&quot;
statement then there must be an observation otherwise there would not have
been that iteration of the data step code so &quot;<TT>if ll&lt;2 then
put _page_;</TT>&quot; is good.</P>

<P>Now this section may seem very trivial. But you have got to look after
silly details like this. You make sure the little things are right before
you can go on to the more significant things. You have got to start from
the trivial and work your way up to the important. It is like programming
backwards and you have got to do it like that. &quot;Look after the pennies
and the pounds will look after themselves&quot; is an English saying and
that is the way you have to program &quot;data _null_&quot; reports. Never
&quot;think big&quot; and then later fill in the smaller details. Always
&quot;think small&quot; and work your way up when doing &quot;data _null_&quot;
reports.</P>

<H2>Make your report &quot;linesize&quot; independent</H2>

<P>You should not &quot;put&quot; at a specific column, assuming the linesize
in effect. You need to read the linesize in effect into your data _null_
and you should also have a variable you set to your report width and so
work out your start column from that (startcol=floor((ls-repwidth)/2)+1).
You can read any option you like in the data _null_ step using the getoption()
function so you can get all the information you need. At the first iteration
of the data step (_n_=1) then get and store the linesize value and from
the report width work out the start column for your report and store it.
The code has the algorithm for that. Use this &quot;start column&quot;
value to &quot;put&quot; your values and &quot;put&quot; things not at
the start column as an offset from this value.</P>

<H2>Using the &quot;titles&quot; and &quot;footnotes&quot; options on the
&quot;file&quot; statement</H2>

<P>Use both the &quot;titles&quot; and &quot;footnotes&quot; statement
on the file statement even if you intend to handle the titles and footnotes
manually. Read the titles into a dataset, if required, and then nullify
them with a &quot;<TT>title1;</TT>&quot; before outputting them but always
have that &quot;titles&quot; option present. You may get strange page throws
if you do not. This is a known <A HREF="http://www.sas.com/service/techsup/unotes/SN/003/003818.html">bug</A>.
Titles can always be recreated from a suitable dataset using the %titlegen
macro if required after you nullified them, so long as the titles are in
a dataset somewhere.</P>

<H2>Give your data _null_ titles the &quot;proc print&quot; and &quot;proc
report&quot; feel</H2>

<P>The more you can make your &quot;data _null_&quot; behave like &quot;proc
print&quot; or &quot;proc report&quot;, when it comes to titles, the better.
If the &quot;byline&quot; option is set then put out a dashed &quot;byline&quot;.
If not, then don't. Does your &quot;by&quot; variable have a label? If
so, then your dashed byline should have the text of your variable label
in it on the left of the equals sign. If the variable has no label then
it should just be the variable name. If that's the way &quot;proc report&quot;
or &quot;proc print&quot; does it then do it that way with your &quot;data
_null&quot;. Get it to interface with #byval and #byvar entries if they
exist. Give people the feel that &quot;data _null_&quot; reporting is no
different to using &quot;proc print&quot; or &quot;proc report&quot; and
you will have less opposition to your &quot;data _null_&quot; reports.
How you do this is already in those two pages. You are going to find yourself
in a situation whereby you really <B><I>must</I></B> do the report using
data _null_ but other people are not comfortable with it becasue they feel
it is &quot;too different&quot; than using &quot;proc report&quot;. The
more you can give it the same feel, the more easily you can dip into &quot;data
_null_&quot; when you have to without people worrying.</P>

<H2>Watch out for leading spaces</H2>

<P>When you &quot;put&quot; a string then be careful of leading spaces.
If you &quot;put&quot; it at a specific column and the string has leading
spaces then you will lose those leading spaces. You should put it at a
position compensated for leading spaces. You do this by offsetting by an
extra &quot;<TT>length(str)-length(left(str))</TT>&quot;.</P>

<H2>put @;</H2>

<P>Don't forget that a &quot;put&quot; statement need not be a commital.
If you follow it with a &quot;@&quot; then you have not written out the
line yet. You can use this technique to &quot;put&quot; out identifying
information before you actually &quot;put&quot; out a data value. It's
called a &quot;trailing at&quot;. You can use this to ready identifying
information and then you can complete it with &quot;put&quot;ting out your
field or if it is blank then just use a plain &quot;put;&quot; statement
to commit what you have to output.</P>

<H2>_file_</H2>

<P>You can load information into the file output buffer and manipulate
it there before you write it out. If you check the code examples you will
see that for the &quot;byline&quot; I fill _file_ with dashes up to the
length of linesize and then substring it with the by= value string.</P>

<H2>Labelled sections of code</H2>

<P>You will have a section to put out your titles or column headers. Nearly
everybody calls it &quot;header&quot; and they specify &quot;header=header&quot;
in the file statement. It is not a reserved word for the label. You can
call it anything, within syntax limitations. But it doesn't have to be
the one and only labelled section in your data step. You can have as many
as you wish. The &quot;header&quot; label will automatically get linked
to when a page is thrown so you don't have to worry about &quot;link&quot;ing
to it. But if you have other pieces of logic, like for handling identifier
variable information, then you could always put this in labelled sections
and &quot;link&quot; to it. Don't forget those &quot;return;&quot; statements,
though.</P>

<H2>&quot;Stacked&quot; identifier information</H2>

<P>Suppose you have identifier information that is being stacked four deep
like age/race/sex/weight. Don't assume you have four observations always
per identifier. You might only have one observation for this group. But
if you only show the one observation then you will still have to show the
full age/race/sex/weight. So you will have to keep a count of where you
are from the start of the group and act if the number of observations was
not enough to complete the group identifying information. Again, the code
will show how I have handled this.</P>

<P>Also consider whether you want to start a new group like this at the
bottom of a page. If there are only two lines left and your identifier
information is displayed over four lines then maybe it is better to throw
a new page before you start. It might be worth your while keeping an observation
count for each stacked group so if you were stacking four deep and you
had only one observation then you could easily put this group in the last
four lines of the page. Since good use of space might be important then
this might be a wise idea.</P>
