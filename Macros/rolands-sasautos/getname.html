</B><P>If you have a userid and you want to know the name of the person who owns it, then you can find out by issuing this command:</P>
<B><TT><P>ypcat passwd</P>
</B></TT><P>..and piping it to grep like this:</P>
<B><TT><P>ypcat passwd | grep userid</P>
</B></TT><P>This would give you a whole line of information with fields in it separated by colons. You want the fifth field with the name in it. Also there is a small chance that you will get more than one line if you have another userid that starts the same as the userid you are looking for. Perhaps grep isn't so good at this task. Let me introduce you to another utility called <B>awk</B>. With awk you can more easily look at the different fields in lines with separator characters. The userid will be in the first field and we want to extract the fifth field. Take a look at this command:</P>
<B><TT><P>ypcat passwd | awk -F: '{if ($1=="'$userid'") {print $5}}'</P>
</B></TT><P>The above is the awk way of doing it. You are piping to awk and telling it that the field separator character is a colon by doing this "<B>-F:</B>". You are then saying that if the first field equals what you have set up in the variable "userid" then you want the fifth field printed.</P>
<P>We have what we want but there is no way either you or I are going to remember it all. Even if we could then it is too long to type in. So we are going to turn it into a script and I will describe a bit more about the script.</P>
<P>If you write a script then you should store it in a script library that will be recognized as such when you log on. I described setting up a library like this on this <A HREF="unixstart.html">page</A>. If you think of a script like a SAS macro then it should have a standard header with useful information in it. So without further ado I am going to show you the script with these commands in it and will then describe its components.</P>

</B><P>It's mostly header, as you can see, with the command we decided to use right at the end. But there is a little bit more that needs explaining. Comments, in shell scripts, are indicated by hash symbols. Everything after a hash symbol is comment. So you can see that the header is all comment lines. However, the top line is not quite a comment line. Because there is more than one scripting language, you have got to let Unix know what shell you want to run your script because if the wrong shell tries to run it then the syntax may not be understood. So the top line contains "<B>!/bin/sh</B>". This is telling Unix that you want the shell program located at <B>/bin/sh</B> to run it. This is the Bourne shell. If you wanted the Korn shell to run it then that top line would contain <B>!/bin/ksh</B> instead. (Go to that directory, if you want to, by typing in the command <B>cd /bin/</B> and you will see many executable programs there).</P>
<P>Now look at the lines that follow the header. <B>$#</B> represents the number of parameters you supplied to the script. What the code is saying is that if the number of parameters supplied was less than one (in other words, none were supplied) then the variable "userid" should be set to the invoker's userid which will be defined to the USER system environment variable. Otherwise, if a parameter were supplied, then userid should be set to the value of that first parameter. Note also how many lines are used to code this. If you were to put the "then" on the same line as the "if" then you would get a syntax error. Scripts only expect one statement per line. If you want to put more than one statement on a line then you have to use a semi-colon to separate them. In SAS, you use a semi-colon to tell the compiler where your statement ends. With shell scripts, you use a semicolon to warn the interpreter that you have more than one statement on a line.</P>
<P>And now to try out the script. Create a member in your shell script library called "getname" and copy the shell code into it. Then try typing in the command <B>getname</B> at the terminal and hopefully it will return your own name. Then find out somebody else's Unix userid who you know and try out <B>getname userid</B> and see that you get their name displayed.</P>
