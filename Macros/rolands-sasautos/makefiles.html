<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Makefiles vs. Scripts</H1>

<P><B>[last updated - 06 August 2003]</B></P>

<H2>The &quot;make&quot; utility</H2>

<P>I admire the &quot;make&quot; utility that comes with Unix. It's an
impressive piece of software that, given the dependencies between programs
and files, will run generate a script to run programs in the correct order
so that all the dependencies are met. Also in the way that it knows when
files have been updated and will run from that point. If I had written
the &quot;make&quot; utility then I would be a proud person. But, I feel
there is a problem behind its use. Pharmaceutical companies will have written
a utilitiy that will generate the makefile from the dependencies in the
program. But the program it trawls through to find these dependencies may
call other macros or &quot;include&quot; files where dependencies are hidden.
To overcome this it may then become a &quot;standard&quot; to add all dependencies
in the header of the macro so this can be spotted by the utility to create
the &quot;makefile&quot;. But if you do that then you are adding an overhead
onto your maintenance in order to service a utility. And if whatever it
produces might be incomplete and require programmer intervention then perhaps
a simpler system would do the job more efficiently and effectively. So
if your &quot;makefile&quot; utility at your site is working fine and requires
no further input then carry on as you are. But if you are having major
problems with it that are not easily resolved then perhaps you could look
at running all your programs in a generated script. I have written such
scripts in the past. And where it has not been a regulatory requirement
to use a &quot;makefile&quot;, I have always opted for a script solution.
I feel it is simpler and better. It does its job and saves time and effort.</P>

<H2>intermediate dataset script</H2>

<P>I assume you report from &quot;value added&quot; intermediate datasets.
I have discussed this approach on another page on this website. These will
be in a directory somewhere. You might have only one directory for all
your programs. You might have several. In using a script approach for running
a suite of programs then without the dependencies that the &quot;make&quot;
utility can find then you will have to name your programs in alphabetical
order so that the correct dependencies are met. In other words, the program
that creates a dataset that all the other programs need needs to have an
alphabetically lower value. Say <B>a0pat.sas</B> for creating a &quot;pat&quot;
dataset that the other programs need. The other programs could be <B>a1xxx.sas</B>
or <B>a2zzz.sas,</B> or whatever, so long as the alphabetic sequence was
the correct one for the dependencies. I am going to suggest a script for
creating the intermediate datasets you report from but of course I don't
know your setup. If you have studied all the Unix tips and scripts on this
website then you will be in a position to code this yourself based on the
example I have supplied.</P>

<P>So my assumption is that all the programs that build your intermediate
datasets are in their own library called &quot;idsbuild&quot;. Of course,
it won't be like that where you are, but I hope you will be able to follow
my logic and adapt it to your own site. I am going to assume that you have
all sorts of test programs in the directory that hosts the real programs
that build your intermediate datasets. And that all the &quot;real&quot;
programs begin with an &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot; and
are immediately followed by a numeric digit in the program name. That may
not fit your site but you need to know the techniques for picking out your
programs based on criteria like this. In the case of the above, where a
SAS program begins with either &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot;
and is immediately followed by a numeric digit then this command will list
them all:</P>

<P><B><TT>ls [a,b,c][0-9]*.sas</TT></B></P>

<P>(You are learning about &quot;file name matching&quot; which is something
different to &quot;pattern matching&quot; in Unix and this is a very important
thing to learn. I will only teach you how to &quot;walk&quot; with scripts.
Learning how to &quot;run&quot; is something I am leaving you to learn
on your own).</P>

<P>So let's think about what we want our script to do. This program suite
will be creating intermediate dataset so we will want to delete these intermediate
datasets before we start. We will also want to delete any log and list
files for these programs. And if any of these log or list files or intermediate
datsets do not already exist then we are not bothered about it so we can
route any error messages to the Unix dustbin <B>/dev/null</B> . We are
going to generate the script to do this. So the generated script should
explain that it has been generated so that people do not amend it because
the next time it is generated their version will get wiped out. Presumably
some &quot;raw&quot; datasets exist in a directory. Let us suppose we have
a root directory defined to the environment variable RD (environment variables
shoudl always be uppercase) and that our protocol is the next on the directory
and the study is next and that our raw data is in the &quot;raw&quot; directory
underneath that then this would be a script to generate the script to build
all your intermediate datasets. There is another thing. If any of these
intermediate dataset build programs fail then we had better abandon the
rest since it is not going to work for the tables and listings programs
at some stage. Better to abandon the rest if this happens.</P>

<P>Please take time to study the following script. Feel free to amend it.
It won't try to run the programs unless you launch it. One day you will
be asked to write a script like this.</P>

<H2>Tables/Listings report script</H2>

<P>That is the intermediate dataset build taken care of. As for the tables
and listings then these should match with the entries in your &quot;titles&quot;
dataset, wherever that is stored. You should have already created the &quot;intitles&quot;
script. Like I've said in a few places - &quot;It's your call&quot;. If
you have followed me this far then you are already a script programmer.
There may be plenty for you to fix in the scripts I have given you but
you should be up to maintaining them by now. Use this as a basis only:</P>

<H2>Running the whole suite</H2>

<P>At this point you will have a &quot;build&quot; script to build your
intermediate datasets and a &quot;run&quot; script in each tables/listings
directory to run your tables and listings. The final step is to create
a script to run all of them. You will be running the intermediate dataset
build first and if that fails then you might as well abandon the whole
lot. But if that runs to complaetion then maybe you don't care if the odd
table or listing fails. You can look at the output from the script to ascertain
whether it completed or not. Here is a very short script that you can amend
to run the build of the intermediate datasets and the reports. Amend it
as required.</P>
