<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>File permissions (umask &amp; chmod)</H1>

<P><B>[last updated - 03 August 2003]</B></P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>If you are writing SAS programs then presumably you are working as part
of a team and there may be cases where other programmers in your team need
to update your programs (for whatever reason). Maybe you have had to do
this but you find you don't have &quot;write access&quot; to that person's
program. Also, maybe other programmers have complained to you that they
do not have write access to your programs and could you please &quot;change
the permissions&quot; so they can. In the last case then maybe you have
a GUI interface with Unix and you locate the file and change its file permission
by checking on the box that allows your group (team) members to write to
this file. It can become a nuisance if you have many programs where only
you have write access and others need to update it. If you are away from
your desk then time will be lost and frustration can lead to errors being
made. But if you have a good understanding of file permissions in Unix
and you understand about the <B>umask</B> and <B>chmod</B> functions then
all will become easy.</P>

<H2>umask</H2>

<P>First I will tell you about <B>umask</B> but only enough for now. You
will have a Unix login member somewhere that gets run when you log in.
What this is called varies from site to site but it will be in your home
directory as a &quot;hidden file&quot; (which you can reveal using the
<B>ls -a</B> command). In that login member, that you are allowed to edit,
there is usually a umask setting. It is quite often set to <B>umask 022</B>
when a new user account is created and you might still be using that value.
But to allow your team members to edit your program code you have to change
it to <B>umask 002</B>. By changing the middle &quot;2&quot; to &quot;0&quot;
you allow others in your team to edit your files. It is important to check
on this and make this change to 002 if you find it otherwise. And all your
team members should ensure they are using 002. This will solve the problem
of not having write access to each others code. What the umask setting
does is change the default permission of a file when you create it. The
middle &quot;2&quot; says that you don't want your team members to be able
to edit your file. When you change it to &quot;0&quot; then by default
they can. This is the default action on creating a file. You can always
change permissions <B><I>after</I></B> creating it if, for example, you
really did not other team members to edit your file. You could stop them
from even reading it, if you liked. Umask just has this effect when you
first create a file. You'll get to understand why it is a &quot;2&quot;
after reading the next section on <B>chmod</B>. But don't bother thinking
about it for now. All you need to know at this stage is that you and all
members of your team should use the setting &quot;<B>umask 002</B>&quot;
in your login members and you will rarely have problems editing each others
code members.</P>

<H2>chmod</H2>

<P>The <B>chmod</B> command is used for altering file permissions. Now
you might be lucky and have a front end to Unix and you can just change
permissions by clicking in the right box. But what if you had to do this
for ALL your programs in a directory? There might be scores of them. You
would save yourself a lot of time in this case by knowing how to use <B>chmod</B>
to change their permissions in bulk. This is what we are going to learn
here.</P>

<P>Before we start, you have to learn that there are three sets of permissions.
The ones that affect the <B>u</B>ser (the owner - you) , <B>g</B>roup (your
team) and <B>o</B>thers. And there are in turn three types of access to
choose from, <B>r</B>ead, <B>w</B>rite and e<B>x</B>ecute. Note that I
have highlighted the letter <B>u</B>, <B>g</B> and <B>o</B> for user, group
and others and <B>r</B>, <B>w</B>, and <B>x</B> for read, write and execute.
That is because you can use these letters with the chmod utility if you
wish. Usually, the chmod function is used with a three digit number. The
first digit refers to the user, the second to the group and the third to
others (sometimes it is a four digit number in which case the left-most
digiit is used for something different). The actual number is a binary
setting for the permissions where <B>x</B>=1 , <B>w</B>=2 and <B>r</B>=4.
So if you changed a file permission like this <B>chmod 666</B> then you
would be allowing read and write permission for yourself, your team and
anybody else. You do not normally allow outsiders to you team to edit your
work but you would often allow them to read it so you would set this instead
to <B>chmod 664</B> . If this were a script library and the files had to
be executable for them to work then <B>chmod 775</B> would allow anybody
to read them or exeute them but only you or your team to edit them. This
utility can be used on multiple files using a wildcard so if you wanted
everybody in your team to be able to update your sas programs then <B>chmod
664 *.sas</B> will do this. You will get error messages out where it matched
files belonged to other people, since you can not change the permissions
for other peoples files, but all your files would have their permissions
changed. Now suppose your project had finished and you did not want anybody
to update or delete and of the sas programs. Then <B>chmod 444</B> would
have this effect.</P>

<P>And now back to umask. Umask has three digits as well and these correspond
to the digits in chmod. It is effectively masking settings for chmod. So
if you have a setting <B>umask 022</B> it is masking the <B>w</B>rite attribute
for <B>g</B>roup (your team) and <B>o</B>thers but f you have setting <B>umask
002</B> then it only masks the <B>w</B>rite attribute for <B>o</B>thers.
umask and chmod work together like this.</P>

<H2>Viewing file permissions</H2>

<P>To see the permissions that files have you use the <B>ls -l</B> command
(the<B> -l</B> indicating <B>l</B>ong form). You will see something like
this:</P>

<P><TT>-rwxr-xr-x</TT></P>

<P>..on the far left. The first position is just a &quot;-&quot; to indicate
a file (it will be &quot;d&quot; for a directory and &quot;l&quot; for
a link). The next three positions are the read, write execute setting for
the user (the owner). The next three are for the group and the last three
for others. So in the example above you see that it is a file and the user
(owner) had read, write and execute permissions, the group has read and
execute permissions and others have the same as the group.</P>

<H2>chmod toggling</H2>

<P>Instead of using chmod in the form <B>chmod nnn</B> you can toggle on
and off the permissions using letter notation. Not all implementations
of Unix work the same way, though. For example, you could switch on execute
permissions for all users with <B>chmod +x</B> or alternatively toggle
it off with <B>chmod -x</B> . You could apply this to just group and others
like this <B>chmod go+w</B> (toggle on write for group and others). You
could specify it like this <B>chmod go=rx</B> (group and others have rx
access) but this is not toggling but rather setting things directly. You
should refer to documentation for full information on this.</P>

<H2>chmod calculator</H2>

<P>Peter Crouch has a chmod calculator that uses Javascript on his page
here http://javascriptkit.com/script/script2/chmodcal.shtml and it is included
below. This could help you with the chmod numeric settings.</P>
