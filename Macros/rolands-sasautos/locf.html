<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>&quot;LOCF&quot; stands for &quot;Last Observation Carried Forward&quot;,
right? Well actually it does and it doesn't. It doesn't mean last SAS dataset
observation carried forward. It means last non-missing value carried forward.
It is the values of individual measures that are the &quot;observations&quot;
in this case. And if you have multiple variables containing these values
then they will be carried forward independently. If you are a SAS programmer
but not a statistician it is very easy to fall into the trap of thinking
the &quot;observation&quot; being carried forward is an observation in
a SAS dataset. It isn't. And if you code on that basis then you will be
making a mistake. It is the non-missing values that are being carried forward
and they are being carried forward independently at that. This makes things
an awful lot more complicated. </P>

<P>I have seen code to do this processing using arrays. In one sense this
is a good idea since it is the most efficient way of handling it. However,
the solution using this method never struck me as being elegant. I feel
the array method springs from an incorrect assumption of what can be achieved
using merges.</P>

<H2>LOCF Merging</H2>

<P>For some reason, people think a merge as in the following can not be
done.</P>

<P>Values to carry forward (<B>values</B> dataset)<BR>
<B><TT>&nbsp;date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value<BR>
01jan02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<BR>
01mar02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
01may02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<BR>
<BR>
</TT></B>Dates to merge with (<B>dates</B> dataset)<BR>
<B><TT>&nbsp;date<BR>
01jan02<BR>
01feb02<BR>
01mar02<BR>
01apr02<BR>
01may02<BR>
01jun02</TT></B></P>

<P>Resulting dataset (<B>final</B> dataset)<BR>
<B><TT>&nbsp;date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value<BR>
01jan02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<BR>
01feb02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<BR>
01mar02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
01apr02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
01may02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<BR>
01jun02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</TT></B></P>

<P>Well, it can't be done using only the variables shown above. But what
we can do is add a sequence number to the &quot;dates&quot; dataset and
increment it when we get a match on date with the &quot;values&quot; dataset
like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>data dates;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;retain _seq 0;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;merge dates values(in=_val);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by date;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if _val then _seq=_seq+1;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P>And now we have a sequence number that retains its value corresponding
to each observation in the values dataset. So if we simply add the same
sequence number to the &quot;values&quot; dataset like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>data values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;set values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;_seq=_n_;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P>.... we can merge like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>data final;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;merge dates values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by _seq;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drop _seq;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P>And this gives us the type of merge we need for LOCF merging. If you
need further convincing, then here is some code you can copy and paste
and run under sas.</P>

<P><B><TT>data values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01jan2002'd;value=1;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01mar2002'd;value=2;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01may2002'd;value=3;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;format date date7.;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>data dates;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01jan2002'd;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01feb2002'd;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01mar2002'd;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01apr2002'd;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01may2002'd;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;date='01jun2002'd;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;format date date7.;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>data dates;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;retain _seq 0;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;merge dates values(in=_val keep=date);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by date;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if _val then _seq=_seq+1;<BR>
run;<BR>
<BR>
data values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;set values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;_seq=_n_;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>data final;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;merge dates values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by _seq;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drop _seq;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>options nocenter;<BR>
proc print data=final;<BR>
run;<BR>
<BR>
</TT></B>And if you go to the trouble to run it under sas then this is
what you get for a print of the &quot;final&quot; dataset:</P>

<P><B><TT>Obs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
value</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01JAN02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
<BR>
&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01FEB02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
<BR>
&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01MAR02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2
<BR>
&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01APR02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2
<BR>
&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01MAY02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3
<BR>
&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01JUN02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3
</TT></B></P>

<P>The above is what we want, I am sure you will agree. So at least, in
principle, it is possible to merge values in with a time sequence using
a sequence.variable we have created. The above is very simple test data,
of course, but we can use the same principle in more complex cases. In
reality we will have an owner variable such as a subject-id that changes.
There may be subcategories like a lab parameter. We would probably use
visit numbers instead of dates. But the same principle of adding a sequence
number to both datasets and merging using that sequence number could still
apply. And it is this principle I have used in my macro solution for this
sort of processing.</P>

<H2>More Complex LOCF Merging</H2>

<P>Let's drop the use of dates and assume we have visit numbers that ascend
with time. Also that we have multiple subjects and that we are dealing
with lab data with multiple measures. Suppose we have datasets like the
following:</P>

<P>(<B>values</B> dataset)<BR>
<B><TT>subj&nbsp;&nbsp;param&nbsp;&nbsp;visit&nbsp;&nbsp;value<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33<BR>
&nbsp;BB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55</TT></B></P>

<P>(<B>visits</B> dataset)<BR>
<B><TT>subj&nbsp;&nbsp;param&nbsp;&nbsp;visit<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<BR>
&nbsp;AA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<BR>
&nbsp;AA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WBC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<BR>
&nbsp;BB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<BR>
&nbsp;BB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<BR>
&nbsp;BB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<BR>
&nbsp;BB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</TT></B></P>

<P>Now before we decide on how to merge these datasets, take a look at
the &quot;visits&quot; dataset. Visits 2-5 are the &quot;on-treatment&quot;
visits right up to the planned end point which is visit 5. It is for these
visits we want to carry forward our last observation. Visit 1 is not shown
because it is likely a baseline value and because it was not a measure
taken while on and as a result of treatment we would probably not want
to carry forward these baseline values. So Visits 2-5 are the &quot;eligible&quot;
visit values for carrying forward. Now look at the values dataset. Again
these only have the &quot;eligible&quot; visits and their values and these
will be the values we will be carrying forward where required. Note that
the subj/param pairings in the &quot;visits&quot; dataset match those in
the values dataset. It makes sense to only have subj/param pairings to
match values otherwise you would have nothing to carry forward. But this
is an assumption. You should understand the assumptions being made. Sometimes
the assumptions will not be approppriate for a study you are working on
and you might have to change the logic.</P>

<P>Now consider how we are going to approach the merge of the two datasets.
Look at the data for subject AA. We would not want to carry forward values
of RBC into the following WBC so obviously we will be merging using matching
on the subj/param pairing. We will have to reset our sequence count at
the start of each subj/param grouping and increment from there. And when
we add the sequence number to the &quot;values&quot; dataset we will have
to do the same so that when we merge using subj/param/_seq we will get
the correct matching.</P>

<P>First read through the following code until you understand what it is
doing. The first two data steps generate the observations as shown above.
The next two data steps add the sequence number and the final data step
merges the data before printing it. Then copy and paste the code, run it
under sas and convince yourself that it is producing the correct output:</P>

<P><B><TT>data values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subj='AA';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;param='RBC';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;visit=2;value=22;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;visit=4;value=44;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;param='WBC';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;visit=3;value=33;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subj='BB';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;param='ALB';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;visit=3;value=55;output;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>data visits;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subj='AA';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do param='RBC', 'WBC';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do visit=2 to 5;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subj='BB';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;param='ALB';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do visit=2 to 5;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>data visits;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;retain _seq 0;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;merge visits values(in=_val keep=subj param visit);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by subj param visit;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if first.param then _seq=0;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if _val then _seq=_seq+1;<BR>
run;<BR>
<BR>
data values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;retain _seq 0;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;set values;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by subj param;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if first.param then _seq=0;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;_seq=_seq+1;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>data final;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;merge values visits;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by subj param _seq;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drop _seq;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<P><B><TT>options nocenter;<BR>
proc print data=final;<BR>
run;</TT></B></P>

<H2>The Macro Solution - %locf</H2>

<P>The macro I wrote to do this processing uses the method of merging shown
above. It will operate on whatever data you feed into the macro. You should
only feed it data that is eligible for carrying forward (for example, you
would not feed in baseline visit data if baseline values were not eligible
for carrying forward). It is your responsibility to prepare the data beforehand
if needed. Non-missing for numeric values means not equal to missing value.
Non-missing for a character variable means not a blank. If &quot;0&quot;
signifies missing for some of your numeric variables then the dataset you
feed in to the %locf macro will have to be an amended one with the 0's
set to missing values. The same applies to the character variables. You
have to do all the data preparation. The %locf macro does none. And if
you want only one or two timepoints in the output dataset then you have
to make that selection. The %locf macro will not do it for you. This way
I can keep the macro as simple as possible and that way it should stay
maintainable.</P>

<P>You should regard this macro as <B><I>a</I></B> solution rather than
<B><I>the</I></B> solution. You need to understand what it is doing and
what assumptions are being made. It may or may not match with your study
requirements. You might end up writing a new macro that fits your site
standards better, based on this macro. I can only go so far with it and
keep it as generic and as simple as possible. If you want to develop it
further then feel free. To view the latest version, click <A HREF="locf.sas">here</A>.
