<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Before you Start with SAS and Unix</H1>

<P><B>[last updated - 21 July 2003]</B></P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The first hurdle to overcome is nothing to do with SAS. It is purely
to do with making sure your Unix environment will recognise a library you
will set up containing your scripts. In some cases you may have a second
hurdle to jump so that your Unix system can run SAS at all.</P>

<P>The first thing I'd like you to try out is typing in the command <B>hw</B>
in Unix. Hopefully you will get a message saying something like <B>&quot;command
not found&quot;</B>. Now, in your script library I want you to create a
member called <B>hw</B> (with <B>no</B> file extension) with the single
line <B>echo &quot;Hello World&quot;</B> in it. If you are working on Unix
then it is easy to create a file with no extension. If you are working
on a Windows platform you might have difficulty leaving off this file extension.
You might have to go into DOS and go to the directory and list the files
there using <B>dir</B> and if you see that your file has an extension then
rename it something like <B>ren hw.txt hw</B> .</P>

<H2>echo $PATH</H2>

<P>In Unix, the search path for finding executable programs and scripts
is assigned to a system environment variable called <B>PATH</B> (uppercase
as all system environment variables are supposed to be). As you are a SAS
programmer you can think of it as a sort of format search path. You can
see what has been set up to this variable by typing in the command <B>echo
$PATH</B>. I&nbsp;want you to do this and note that the entries are separated
by a colon. Also you need to note if there is anything odd about the entries.
If you are working on a Unix platform proper then there is unlikely to
be anything odd. But I am working on cygwin Linux and I see that instead
of the <B>C </B>drive being referred to as <B>C:/ </B>it is being referred
to as <B>cygdrive/c/ </B>so I will have to do the same.</P>

<H2>.bashrc, .bashrc.own, .bash_login, etc. etc. etc. </H2>

<P>In most Unix installations, you have you own personal directory. If
you type in the command <B>&quot;cd $HOME&quot;</B> or <B>&quot;cd ~&quot;</B>
you should get to it. The command means someting like &quot;make my home
area the current directory&quot;. You might have a GUI interface for your
Unix platform. You might not. But you hopefully have an editor you can
use to edit the files in your home directory. Here I can give you very
little help. Your first mission, should you decide to accept it, is to
either create or make an edit to that member of yours that gets called
by Unix when it starts you up. What you are going to do is add your scripts
library to the search path so that when you invoke a member of that library
it can be found. Like I say, this varies from installation to installation.
You will have to ask somebody in the know at your site. There's not a lot
I can do to help you. Most Unix installations have a <B>.bashrc.own</B>
file that you can put your own commands in. But this may only be read when
you start up a new Unix session rather than when you log in. You need the
member that takes effect when you log in. It might be <B>.bashrc.login</B>.
It might be <B>.bash.login.own</B>. I am using cygwin Linux and found out
that in my <B>/home/Default</B> folder I needed to create a member called
<B>.bash_login</B> to do this. Also, note that these files begin with a
period. They are hidden files. If you list for them using the Unix <B>ls</B>
command then they will not be listed. You have to use <B>ls -a</B> to list
these hidden files. When you find out what this correct member should be
called and create it, if it doesn't exist, then I want you to add a line
at the end that puts your script library at the end of the search path.
Since I have cygwin and have stored my script library on the <B>C:</B>
drive rather than in the cygwin area then I created a member called <B>.bash_login</B>
and added the line <B>PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/shellscripts</B> . What this
line is doing is resolving the contents of PATH as it now stands using
the &quot;$&quot; in front (very much like you would resolve a global macro
variable in SAS with a &quot;&amp;&quot; in front), adding a &quot;:&quot;
as a separator and then following it with my script library.</P>

<H2>Getting &quot;hw&quot; to work</H2>

<P>What you are aiming for is getting the command <B>hw</B> to be recognised
as a script in your library and generating the message &quot;Hello World&quot;
at the terminal. This has to take effect directly after you have logged
on. You will have to log out of Unix and log back in before trying this
since you have edited the member that gets read when you log in.</P>

<H2>Getting SAS to work</H2>

<P>If you are running Unix on a Unix system proper then I assume that if
you type in the command <B>sas</B> then SAS will start up. You should try
this or perhaps you use <B>sas8</B> or some other form to invoke SAS. Since
I run cygwin Linux then SAS in not installed in the are so I had to add
the SAS executable location to my PATH as well as adding the shell scripts
library to my path like this:</P>

<P><B><TT>PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/progra~1/sasins~1/sas/v8:/cygdrive/c/shellscripts</TT></B></P>

<P>If you use cygwin or something like on on your PC&nbsp;then note that
I had to refer to the long filenames using the tilde notation.</P>

<H2>The next stage</H2>

<P>Like I said, this page has nothing to do with SAS. It is just setting
up your Unix environment so that it can find your scripts as soon as you
have logged on and can give the &quot;Hello World&quot; message when you
type in the <B>hw</B> command. I've given you all the help I can and the
rest you will have to achieve on your own. Once you have achieved this
(and only then) you are ready to move onto the next <A HREF="sasunix.html">stage</A>.</P>
